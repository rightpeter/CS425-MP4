Jürgen Kurbjuhn (born July 26, 1940 in the town of Tilsit) is a former German football player.

Kurbjuhn had excelled as a youth-international for West Germany during his time with amateur club Buxtehuder SV and joined Hamburg's biggest, Hamburger SV, in 1960 when the club had just been crowned German football champion. In 1961 he was part of the Hamburg side reaching the semi-final of the European Cup against Barcelona and part of the 1963 German Cup winning side of the club. He retired, because of injury, after ten goals in 242 Bundesliga matches in 1972.

His West Germany career lasted for only five matches in the space of April 1962 to May 1966, allowing him to stay unused by Sepp Herberger at the 1962 FIFA World Cup but keeping him off another participation as he did not make it into the squad of Herberger's successor Helmut Schön for the 1966 FIFA World Cup. He played his last international on May 4, 1966, when the West Germans beat Ireland 4-0 in a friendly.

From 1988 he owned an insurance company in Buxtehude.

The Fonte di Fata Morgana ('Fata Morgana's Spring'), locally called the Casina delle Fate ('Summerhouse of the Fates'), at Grassina, not far from Florence in the commune of Bagno a Ripoli, is a small garden building, built in 1573-4 as a garden feature in the extensive grounds of the Villa "Riposo" of Bernardo Vecchietti on the slope of the hill called Fattucchia.

It is among that group of artificial garden grottoes and Nympheums made for private gardens, and less well known than more visited examples, such as in the Boboli Gardens or the Medici villa at Pratolino. The Fonte di Fata Morgana is enriched with sculptures in the manner of  Giambologna. Recently acquired by the Comune di Bagno a Ripoli, the Fonte della Fata Morgana, is being meticulously restored.

Warrington South is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.   It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election.

The constituency has the Press Association (PA) number 612.

 Boundaries .
The constituency is one of two covering the unitary authority of Warrington, Cheshire, the other being Warrington North.  It covers the parts of the town lying south of the River Mersey, including Appleton, Grappenhall and Stockton Heath, the town centre and the Penketh and Sankey areas in the west of the town.  It also includes the village of Lymm.

 History .

The constituency was created in 1983.  Prior to then, the Warrington constituency covered the central part of the town and surrounding area, while the southern fringes were in the Runcorn constituency and the surrounding area to the north was covered by the Newton constituency.  The current boundaries were introduced at the 1997 general election, when the number of constituencies in Cheshire were increased and the new Weaver Vale seat was created.

Politically, Warrington South is considered the more interesting of the two Warrington seats.  While Warrington North is a safe seat for the Labour Party, Warrington South is regarded as a bellwether constituency, reflecting the fate of the major parties at the national level.  As such it was held by the Conservatives from 1983 until 1992 (until 1987 by the former Runcorn MP Mark Carlisle, then by Chris Butler), when it was taken by Labour's Mike Hall.  Hall moved to the new Weaver Vale seat in 1997, and Helen Southworth (also of the Labour Party) has represented the seat since then.

Most of the borough council seats in the constituency are held by the Liberal Democrats, who nevertheless have come third in recent general elections, behind the Conservatives.

Bluebeard The Autobiography of Rabo Karabekian (1916-1988) is a 1987 fictional novel by best-selling author Kurt Vonnegut. It is told as a first person narrative and describes the late years of fictional Abstract Expressionist painter Rabo Karabekian, who first appeared, rather briefly, in Breakfast of Champions. Circumstances of the novel bear rough resemblance to the fairy tale of Bluebeard popularized by Charles Perrault.  Karabekian mentions this relationship several times during the novel.

Plot summary.

At the opening of the book, the narrator, Rabo Karabekian apologizes to the arriving guests: "I promised you an autobiography, but something went wrong in the kitchen..." He describes himself as a museum guard, who answers questions to visitors coming to see his priceless collected art. He shares the lonely home with his live-in servants and Paul Slazinger, a wounded World War II veteran.

One afternoon, Circe Berman wanders onto Karabekian's private beach. When he reaches out to greet her, she catches him by surprise with the forward statement "Tell me how your parents died." He tells her the story and proceeds to
invite her back to his home for a drink. After a drink and supper, Karabekian invites her to stay with him, as Slazinger does. After time, he finds her charm "manipulative," as she typically gets her way. Mrs. Berman does not respect his abstract art collection, including works by Jackson Pollock. She explores every inch of Karabekian's home, constantly asking him questions. The only place off limits to her is the potato barn.

The potato barn is the home of Karabekian's studio and holds his "secret". It has no windows, and Karabekian has gone through the trouble of nailing one end shut and immobilizing the other with six padlocks. The secret of the potato barn has enticed collectors to make outrageous offers and to raise suspicions of stolen masterpieces. It is to remain locked until after Karabekian's passes away.

Characters in "Bluebeard".
Rabo Karabekian   Karabekian is a 71 year old, one eyed, Armenian immigrant painter. He lives in 19-room house on the waterfront of East Hampton, Long Island, which he inherited from his second wife Edith.

Circe Berman - Circe selects Karabekian's home as a place to research and write about working-class adolescents living with multimillionaires. She is a well published novelist under the pen name "Polly Madison.";

Paul Slazinger - Slazinger is a poor, wounded World War II veteran. Though he owns his own home, he stays with Karabekian and eats from his kitchen. He refuses permanent residence on the grounds that "he can only write at home." He has had 11 novels published, but is not in the league of Circe Berman.

Dan Gregory - Karabekian became "Gregorian's" apprentice at the age of 17. A magazine article estimated him to be the highest paid artist in American history.

Marilee Kemp - Marilee was Dan Gregory's mistress, who persuaded Gregory to take Karabekian as his apprentice.

Edith Taft - Edith was Karabekian's second wife of 20 years.

Dorothy Roy - Dorothy is Karabekian's first wife. She left with their 2 boys, Terry and Henri. ;

Rabo's Parents - Karabekian's parents were survivors of the Armenian genocide.

Allison White - She is Karabekian's live-in cook, though he never refers to her as anything besides that. She has a daughter Celeste, who also lives with them.

Christian Joseph Edward Stepien (born June 13, 1978 in Toronto, Canada ) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, poet and photographer.   Stepien's music career began in 1998 with the release of "In the middle of...", a collection of folky, acoustic tracks.  His music has since infused a more ska/reggae feel, along the lines of the seminal California group Sublime.  His first foray into poetry came in 2001 with his book "I am not here", followed in rapid succession by "I fall into oblivion" and the critically acclaimed "The Palimpsest mind of Christian Stepien" in 2003.  


The Music Scene.

When Stepien's first band split in 1998, he went solo and decided to perform under the name "Brodie".  He released a 6 song EP entitled "In the middle of..." in September of that year, and soon after Dan Parker joined him forming a duo.  For the next two years the two would release an EP and a full length album, have two of their tracks featured in a USA Network movie entitled The Stalking of Laurie Show, and play shows around Toronto meeting some of the up and coming bands in the city.  They became a staple in the scene, playing along side friends like Billy Talent and The Meligrove Band, having gone to high school with the former.  Eventually, the two went their separate ways and Christian decided to play solo for good.



As a solo artist, and still under the name "Brodie", Christian released another EP and yet another full-length album.  In 2003 he decided to drop the name "Brodie" and start performing under his own name.  

Poetry Takes Over.

In 2001, while taking a poetry course at York University in Toronto, Christian came upon the work of Allen Ginsberg.  He immediately took to the poet, reading everything he could get his hands on.  Over time, Stepien's lyrics had become more and more important to him, and he was starting to feel that it may be time to bring them out from behind the music.  That year he published his first book of poetry entitled "I am not here".  It was released in small numbers, but was a huge step for Christian as an artist.  

The following year he released "I fall into oblivion", followed in 2003 by "The palimpsest mind of Christian Stepien".  Both books were released to critical acclaim, and were accepted into some of the world s most prestigious institutional libraries such as those at Oxford, Harvard and Yale.  

Photography: A New Love.

In 2004 Christian's father gave him his original Pentax Spotmatic camera 
, which he purchased in 1972.  Stepien took to photography quickly, much like with music, and poured all his energy into this newly discovered art form.  Shooting at anything and everything, he spent the first while getting used to the camera and figuring out the technical aspects of the art.  

A few months later he discovered the work of Ansel Adams and he knew he had found his calling.  Simply put, his goal was not to 'reproduce' the shots Adams took, but create a similar 'emotion' that Stepien himself felt when he looked at Ansel's work.  He focused primarily on landscape photography, and spent much of his free time driving through the vast ridge that is the Niagara Escarpment with his brother, Damien Stepien, and girlfriend, Marina Stojanovic.  In 2006 his first gallery exhibition was held in Mississauga, Ontario along side the work of his brother Damien and fellow photographer Susie Hanes.


The Dagobah Project.
In 2006 Christian, along with his brother Damien, created The Dagobah Project, an entity under which all their creative endeavors would be released.  It is much more then an umbrella term for the brothers, however.  In Christian's words, "The philosophy behind the Dagobah Project is simple: live simple, live free, live happy. We strive to make life as peaceful as possible, using art as our vehicle".  

The name Dagobah came from George Lucas's film The Empire Strikes Back and is the planet where the character Yoda lives.  The Stepien brothers decided upon the name not simply because of their affection for all the Star Wars films, but also their admiration for Lucas who to this day remains an independent film maker.

On Art.

"I took up the guitar because I loved music, but soon came to realize that it gave me an identity.  Where once there was just an average teenager now stood a "Musician".

Later I turned to poetry because I loved the way simple words, if manipulated correctly, could evoke such strong emotions in people.  I soon came to realize that in creating poetry I was reflecting upon my life, and in doing so it gave me a sense of self.  Where once there was a simple musician now stood a self-aware human being.  

I then picked up a camera and turned to photography because I loved the way the supposedly "mundane" could have its deserved moment in the spotlight.  While making photographs I came to realize that in closely examining the world around me I was discovering where I, as an inhabitant of this world, fit in.  Where once there was an egocentric artist now stood an empathetic human being.

For me, it has nothing to do with money, fame, or even the products themselves.  For me, creating art is an exploration into the human condition.  It is about becoming attuned to the world, both natural and human, and understanding that life is simply a small flash on a ripple in the whirlpool that is the universe.  Empathy, humility, and wisdom are the goals for which I strive through a vessel that can be summed up in 3 letters: Art." - Christian Stepien

<doc id="617243" title="Dreamtime (album)" nonfiltered="7" processed="7" dbindex="1480006">


Dreamtime is a studio album by The Cult. Out of the shadows of gothic rock, Dreamtime was a bold attempt to fuse the mysticism of The Doors with the passion of The Sex Pistols and giving the first steps to their future hard rock direction. Conjuring up Native American imagery, the album was a curious and romantic creature on the evolutionary path to alternative rock. 
Released on 31 September 1984, it reached #21 in the UK, was certified platinum after having sold 100.000 copies in Britain, and the first single, 'Spiritwalker' reached #1 on the indie charts. Dreamtime has subsequently been reissued (or in some cases bootlegged) in roughly 30 countries worldwide. 

Lyrics to the song 'Horse Nation' are taken almost verbatim from the book titled 'Bury my heart at Wounded Knee'.
'Spiritwalker' is a reference to shamanism, 'Dreamtime' is inspired by the Australian Aborigines, 'Butterflies' is in reference to the Hopi ceremonial butterfly dance.
'A Flower in the Desert' is a reworking of the Southern Death Cult's song 'Flowers in the Forest'.

The record was originally being produced by Joe Julian, but after having recorded the drums tracks the band decided to replace him, and Beggars Banquet suggested John Brand. The record was ultimately produced by Brand, but guitarist Billy Duffy has said that the drum tracks used on the record were those produced by Julian, as Nigel Preston by that time had become too unreliable.

Track listing.
All songs written by Ian Astbury and Billy Duffy, except where noted.
A1 "Horse Nation"   3:45 ;
A2 "Spiritwalker"   3:39 ;
A3 "83rd Dream"   3:38 ;
A4 "Butterflies"   3:00 ;
A5 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)"   3:59 ;
B1 "Gimmick"   3:33 ;
B2 "A Flower in the Desert" (Astbury/Jepson/Burroughs/Quereshi)   3:42 ;
B3 "Dreamtime"   2:47 ;
B4 "Rider in the Snow"   3:11 ;
B5 "Bad Medicine Waltz"   5:55 ;
 "BoneBag"   3:47 (CD bonus track);
 "Sea and Sky"   3:32 (CD bonus track);
 "Resurrection Joe"   6:07 (CD bonus track);
 "Love removal Machine" ("Peace" version) (Russian and eastern Europe only);
 "Zap City" (Russian and eastern Europe only);

There is a slightly longer version of 'Spiritwalker', with a running time of 3:54.

The record was largely recorded at Rockfield studios, in Monmouth, Wales, in late March and early April 1984. Mixed at Eel Pie, Twickenham, 16 - 24 April 1984. Mastered on 27 April 1984.  
This record was originally intended to be released on Situation Two, with a catalogue number SITU 57 (or 12). This pressing was to include the original version of "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)" which uses a psychedelic phasing on the end choruses. Only a small handful of white label test pressings were made of this record, before the band decided they didn't like that version. They subsequently recorded a new version of the song after being signed on to Beggars Banquet Records, and that second, more "finalised" version of the song was released. The rerecording of "Go West (Crazy Spinning Cirlces)" was done at Livingstone studios on 22 June 1984. The original test pressing of "Dreamtime" stands as one of the rarest and arguably most collectable of all Cult vinyl pressings.

'Bone Bag' listed as Bonebag was the original b side on the 'Spiritwalker' single. 'Sea and Sky' was the original b side of 'Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles)' and 'Resurrection Joe' misspelled "Ressurection Joe" was a new single recorded in November 1984 and released on 14 December 1984. They are included as bonus tracks on the original CD pressings in all countries except the original CD pressing in the Netherlands, where only the 10 original songs are present. The first CD version in the Netherlands also uses different artwork for the back cover
Released originally with a nine song live album titled 'Dreamtime Live at the Lyceum', recorded at the Lyceum Theatre in London on 20 May 1984, and also released in the UK with different artwork, and on 23 November 1984 also as a picture disc. There were only 30.000 copies of the live record originally manufactured. This double album version was released in a thicker cardboard sleeve.

In France, a special promotional 12" record was issued, consisting of three tracks: 
 "Spiritwalker";
 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Circles) ";
 "83rd Dream (recorded live at the Lyceum on 20 May 1984)";
The full album was later released in France, packaged with the live album 'Dreamtime live at the Lyceum'.

The Japanese LP features a photo of the band on the front cover, instead of the original artwork.
When remastered and reissued on CD in 1996, only the 10 original songs were included. 

On the original Canadian vinyl pressing, the tracklisting is re-arranged for unknown reasons:

A1 "Gimmick"   3:33 ;
A2 "Spiritwalker"   3:39 ;
A3 "83rd Dream"   3:38 ;
A4 "Butterflies"   3:00 ;
A5 "Bad Medicine Waltz"   5:55 ;
B1 "Horse Nation"   3:45 ;
B2 "A Flower in the Desert" (Astbury/Jepson/Burroughs/Quereshi)   3:42 ;
B3 "Dreamtime"   2:47 ;
B4 "Rider in the Snow"   3:11 ;
B5 "Go West (Crazy Spinning Cirlces)"   3:59;

In Czechoslovakia in January 1991, two versions of this record were released by Globus International: one is on black vinyl, and the other is on blue vinyl. The blue vinyl version is apparently quite rare. Both Czechoslovakian pressings use the artwork from the second British pressing.
In 2003, the album was remastered and reissued on CD in the Russian Federation, Belarus and Lithuania with the three bonus tracks and different artwork. In October 2004 the record was also remastered and reissued on CD with different artwork in Japan.

There is also a misprinted British CD, which uses correct artwork, but includes reggae music on the disc itself, instead of anything by The Cult.

The Persian Encyclopedia (                  ) is one of the most comprehensive and authoritative Encyclopedias written in the Persian language. It is a two-volume encyclopedia published as three physical volumes.

The encyclopedia was based, in part, on the 1953, 1960, and 1968 editions of The Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia. It was initially published under the supervision of Gholamhossein Mosaheb, who started the project in 1955 in the Franklin Book Programs office in Tehran. Mosaheb left the project after the first volume (words starting with Alef to Seen) was published in 1966.

The second volume was actually published in two "parts", making the encyclopedia three physical volumes. The first part (Sheen to Lam) was published in 1978, ten years after the first volume. it was supervised by Reza Aghsa. 

The Iranian revolution in 1979, the death of Mosaheb in the same year, and the takeover of the assets of the Franklin office in Tehran by the government delayed further publication. 

The second part (Meem to Yeh) was published by Amirkabir in 1996, eighteen years after the first part of the volume, but not mentioning a new supervisor's name. 

The encyclopedia total is 3385 three-column pages. Unfortunately, the number of entries in the encyclopedia is not mentioned.

The three volumes were republished with minor changes by Amirkabir in 2002 (ISBN 964-303-044-X).

The first USS McLanahan (DD-264) was a Clemson-class destroyer in the United States Navy and transferred to the Royal Navy where she served as HMS Bradford (H72) during World War II. 

As USS McLanahan.

Named for Tenant McLanahan, McLanahan was laid down 20 April 1918 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Quincy, Massachusetts; launched 22 September 1918; sponsored by Mrs. Charles M. Howe; and commissioned 5 April 1919, Commander R. B. Coffey in command.

After shakedown off the Massachusetts coast, McLanahan was assigned to the Pacific Fleet. At San Diego, California in October 1919 she was placed in reserve and decommissioned in June 1922. She remained at San Diego until recommissioning 18 December 1939. Then, following overhaul and fitting out, she steamed to the east coast. On 8 October 1940 she decommissioned as a U.S. Navy ship at Halifax, Nova Scotia, and commissioned in the Royal Navy, under the terms of the Destroyers for Bases Agreement, as Bradford (H72).

<doc id="7952748" title="Frank Edwards (Irish Communist)" nonfiltered="11" processed="11" dbindex="1480010">
Frank Edwards (1907 7 June 1983) was a teacher and prominent Irish communist.

Edwards's parents were Belfast Catholics who relocated to Waterford.  His father served, and died, in the British Army during the First World War. His elder brother, Jack Edwards, was the Waterford organiser of the one-day general strike against the enforcement of conscription in Ireland.  Jack was active in the Irish War of Independence and then joined the Irregulars in the Irish Civil War.  In Kilkenny Gaol, he was shot "trying to escape" as a reprisal for a Free State officer killed in Waterford.

While teaching at Mount Sion Christian Brothers School, Waterford, Frank Edwards became the Waterford leader of the Republican Congress in 1934. The Roman Catholic Church had denounced the Congress and advised against participation in its foundation meeting.  When Edwards denounced local slum-landlords, not realising that some of the property was owned by the Catholic church, this brought him to the notice of Archdeacon Byrne. Edwards was investigated by the Church authorities and Bishop Kinnane ordered he leave his teaching post.  Edwards was supported at first by his union, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, and a national scandal ensued; but the Church stood firm, stating that the Congress had betrayed "The Republic" and sought to install "the Russian model".

In late 1936 Edwards went to Spain as a member of the Connolly Column, fought in the Front at Lopera (where only 66 of the 150 Irish engaged did not become casualties) and was wounded at Las Rozas on the Madrid Front.

He returned to Ireland, where he was now blacklisted, lost a post with Pye Radio for organising a union, worked as a labourer laying pipes, and, at the outbreak of the Second World War, found a teaching post at Zion School, a Jewish foundation on the South Circular Road.  He retired thirty years later from this "temporary" post.

Edwards was a founder in 1946, and Secretary from 1955 of the Ireland-Soviet Friendship Society.  This led to his reputation as "the Kremlin's man in Dublin".  He died in 1983 after a long illness.

A twisted horseshoe roll is a roller coaster element in which there are two inversions (much like a cobra roll or batwing). It begins with a clockwise corkscrew, a 180 degree banked turn, and ends a second corkscrew, this one going counter-clockwise. 

Despite having a similar name, this element bears no real resemblence to the roller coaster element known as a horseshoe.

The only roller coaster in existence with such an inversion is the as-of-yet-uncompleted Maverick at Cedar Point. On Maverick, the trains exit the twisted horseshoe roll going in the same direction as when they entered, though it would not necessarily be impossible to build such an element in which the trains exit going in the opposite direction (as is the case of a cobra roll or batwing).

George Batten (1854-1918) was a New Jersey native, the former Ayer employee opened George Batten Newspaper Advertising Agency on Park Row in New York in 1891. Fiercely religious and humorless, he endeavored to make his ads 100% accurate. His values and personal dignity are credited with adding respectability to the ad profession. His $8 million-billing agency was merged with the $23 million Barton, Durstine & Osborn (BDO) in 1928, after both agencies had moved into the new office building at 383 Madison Ave., to create BBDO -- and Madison Avenue.

Asa Whitney (1797 - August 1872) was an American merchant and railroad projector.

He was one of the first backers of an American Transcontinental Railway. It was as early as 1830 that Whitney first became enthralled with railroads and foresaw their future role in business and transport. He first stopped on a buying trip, to ride the newly formed Liverpool and Manchester Railway. 

He made one of the first formal proposals to the US Government on building a Transcontinental Railroad. For years he was rejected and continued to write revised memorials and take expeditions through what was then known as Indian Territory to support his cause. After more than ten years of trying he at last gave up. 

Later Whitney's dream was realized through the efforts of Theodore Judah, a young ambitious engineer who tirelessly worked to make the railroad possible.

A fire hazard is any situation in which there is a greater than normal risk of harm to people or property due to fire. Fire hazards can take the form of ways that fires can easily start, such as a blocked cooling vent, or overloaded electrical system, ways fires can spread rapidly, such as an insufficiently protected fuel store or areas with high oxygen concentrations, or things which, in a fire, pose a hazard to people, such as materials that produce toxic fumes when heated or blocked fire exits.

The "spot" resolutions were offered in the United States House of Representatives on 22 December 1847 by Abraham Lincoln, Whig representative from Illinois. The resolutions requested President James K. Polk to provide Congress with the exact location (the "spot") upon which blood was spilt on American soil, as Polk had claimed in 1846 when asking Congress to declare war on Mexico. So persistent was Lincoln in pushing his "spot resolutions" that some began referring to him as "spotty Lincoln." Lincoln's resolutions were a direct challenge to the validity of the president's words, and representative of an ongoing political power struggle between Whigs and Democrats. 

According to Lincoln biographer David Herbert Donald, "nobody paid much attention to his resolutions, which the House neither debated nor adopted". Many Democrats regarded the resolutions as unpatriotic; some Whigs cautioned that criticism of the war would hurt the Whigs politically. Lincoln, however, was not speaking out against the war itself, but rather against Polk's conduct of it. The Whigs would in fact nominate as their candidate Zachary Taylor, a hero of the war, whom Lincoln supported.

In Polk's report, the President stated that the American soldiers fell on American soil, but they actually fell on disputed territory that Mexico had historical claims to. To find out where the soldiers fell was important because Congress was near to declaring war on Mexico.

Rusyn is an East Slavic language (along with Russian, Belarusian and Ukrainian to which it shares a common linguistic ancestry) that is spoken by the Rusyns.  There is controversy among linguists concerning whether Rusyn is a separate East Slavic language or a dialect of Ukrainian .

It is spoken in the Transcarpathian Region of Ukraine, in eastern Slovakia, southern Poland (where it is often called  emkowski 'Lemko', from their characteristic word lem/    'only'), and Hungary. The Pannonian Rusyn language in Serbia is sometimes considered part of the Rusyn language, although some linguists consider that language to be West Slavic. In Ukraine, Rusyn is often considered a dialect of Ukrainian, as it is very close to the Hutsul dialect of Ukrainian, but speakers sometimes prefer to consider themselves distinct from Ukrainians.

Attempts to standardize the language suffer from its being divided between four countries, so that in each of these countries there has been devised a separate orthography (in each case with Cyrillic letters) and grammatical standard, based on different Rusyn dialects. The cultural centres of Carpatho-Rusyn are Prešov in Slovakia, Uzhhorod and Mukacheve in Ukraine, Krynica and Legnica in Poland, and Budapest in Hungary. Many very active Rusyns also live in Canada and the USA.

It is very difficult to count the speakers of Rusyn, but their number is sometimes estimated at almost a million, most of them in Ukraine and Slovakia. The first country to officially recognize Rusyn, more exactly Pannonian Rusyn, as an official language was former Yugoslavia. In 1995, Rusyn was recognized as a minority language in Slovakia, enjoying the status of official language in municipalities where more than 20% of the inhabitants speak Rusyn.

 The Rusyn language is divided as follows: ;
 Hutsul is spoken in the mountainous part of Suceava County and Maramures County in Romania and the extreme southern parts of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast (as well as in parts of the Chernivtsi and Transcarpathian Oblasts, and on the northern slopes of the Carpathian Mountains. ;
 Boyko is spoken on the northern side of the Carpathian Mountains in the Lviv and Ivano-Frankivsk Oblasts. It can also be heard across the border in the Subcarpathian Voivodship of Poland ;
 Lemko is spoken outside Ukraine in the Prešov Region of Slovakia along the southern side of the Carpathian Mountains. ;
 Dolinian Rusyn or Subcarpathian Rusyn is spoken in the Transcarpathian Oblast.;
 Pryashiv Rusyn is the Rusyn spoken in the Prešov (in Rusyn: Pryashiv/Pryashuv)  region of Slovakia, as well as by some émigré communities, primarily in the United States of America. ;
 Ba ka Rusyn is spoken in northwestern Serbia and eastern Croatia. Rusin language of the Ba ka dialect is one of the official languages of the Serbian Autonomous Province of Vojvodina).

In the introduction to the book "Slavic languages," written in 1973, ten years before glasnost, Samuel Bernshtein writes about "western Ukrainians" and the "literary language" which they "until recently 1973" had.

The North Side Gang, also known as the North Side Mob, was the dominant Irish-American criminal organization (although a large number of Polish and German-Americans were members as well) within Chicago during the Prohibition from the early to late 1920s and principal rival of the Johnny Torrio-Al Capone organization, later known as the Chicago Outfit. 

Impact of the North Side Gang. 


History of the North Side Gang.
Early history.
The North Side Gang, like many other Chicago based Prohibition gangs, originally formed from the numerous street gangs in existence during the turn of the century, particularly the Market Street Gang. A street gang made up of pick pockets, sneak thieves and labor sluggers which occupied the 42nd and 43rd Wards prior to World War I, the group especially distinguished itself during the "Circulation Wars" of the early 1910s between the newspapers Chicago Examiner and Chicago Tribune. It was during the Circulation Wars that future Northside leader Dion O'Bannion, then a member of the juvenile satellite Little Hellions, who would develop valuable contacts including politicians and journalists. O'Bannion and other members of the Northsiders would be mentored by safecracker Charles Reiser prior to Prohibition. Upon the announcement of the Volstead Act in 1919, O'Bannion was one of the many members of the Market Streeters to enter bootlegging during the first years of Prohibition.

Prohibition.
Originally based on the North Clark Street restaurant McGovern's Saloon and Cafe, the Northsiders, upon taking control of the breweries and distilleries in operation following the passage of the Volstead Act (thus ensuring a near monopoly on supplying real beer and high quality whiskey compared to the rotgut liquor and moonshine of rival competitors), would soon control the working class neighborhoods of the 42nd and 43rd Wards within months of Prohibition (although they continued committing burglary of local stores and warehouses and running illegal gambling operations). Strengthening his political protection through election fraud as well as a publicity campaign with large scale donations to orphanages and charities as well as giving out food and loans to the poor and unemployed in the neighborhoods of Chicago's North Side. 

As Sicilian and other Italian-American gangs arose in Chicago's Southside, such as the Gennas and later arrival of Johnny Torrio and Al Capone, O'Bannion's steadfast resistance to sell portions of North Side distilleries (as well as pre-existing hostility between Irish and Italian-Americans) would cause tensions to rise between the two groups. During several meetings arranged by Torrio, O'Bannion would often provoke the Italians weither by direct insults or through hijacking beer shipments and selling it back to the owners. However, the North Side Gang would also have trouble with other ethnic gangs, including a 1921 incident in which O'Bannion shot Ragen's Colts member Davy "Yiddles" Miller after insulting a North Side member at a local opera. 

Although O'Bannion and Weiss were arrested and charged with burglary in 1922, the North Side Gang enjoyed considerable police protection from the Chicago police department despite a later investigation by Chicago reform Mayor William E. Dever following the attendance of several high ranking police officials including Chief Detective Michael Hughes and Lieutenant Charles Evans (as well as County Clerk Robert Sweitzer and Public Works commissioner Colonel Albert A. Sprague with a large number of Democrat and Republican politicians) at a banquet hosted in honor of O'Bannion, later dubbed by the press as the "Balshazzar Feast". Chicago police would also assist the North Side Gang, most notably in the 1924 robbery of the Sibly Distillery, then under federal guard since the beginning of Prohibition, when O'Bannion gunmen looted the distillery in broad daylight carrying away 1,750 bonded whiskey worth around $1 million and were escorted by Police Lieutenant Michael Grady and four detective sergeants (although later indicted, charges against Grady and the other police officers were quickly dismissed). 

Although agreeing in early 1924 to an uneasy alliance with Torrio and Capone, largely brokered by Mike Merlo, relations between the two organizations quickly began to dissolve following O'Bannion's demands to collect a $30,000 gambling debt from "Bloody" Angelo Genna (who, with members of his gang, were allowed to be exempted from payment) from losses at the co-owned gambling casino The Ship. 

Although Torrio persuaded Genna to pay his gambling debt, O'Bannion further provoked Torrio after arranging a police raid on one of his own breweries when he attempted to sell Torrio the valuable Sieben Brewery on May 19. It was after Torrio's release, after demands from the Gennas, that he agreed the gang leader be killed. 

On November 10, shortly after the death of Merlo, O'Bannion was killed when three unidentified men entered his flower shop and shot him several times. This was to be the beginning of a five year gang war between the North Side Gang against Johnny Torrio's Chicago Outfit that would end only with the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in 1929.

War with the Chicago Outfit.
After the death of Dion O'Banion, Hymie Weiss assumed leadership of the gang and on January 12, 1925, Weiss, with Bugs Moran and Vincent Drucci, attempted to kill Al Capone at a Chicago South Side restaurant, firing at Capone's car and injuring chauffeur Sylvester Barton although Capone was unharmed.

On January 24, shortly after the assassination attempt on Capone, Weiss, again with Moran, Drucci, and Frank Gusenberg ambushed Torrio as he returned from shopping with his wife. Shooting him several times, Torrio was wounded along with his chauffeur Robert Barton. As George Moran was about to kill the wounded Torrio, the gun misfired and the gang members were forced to flee the scene as the police arrived. Although surviving the attack, Torrio quickly decided to retire to Italy and gave leadership of Torrio's organization to his lieutenant Al Capone.

The Northsiders under Weiss, Drucci and Moran. 


St. Valentine's Day Massacre.
On February 14, 1929 four unidentified men, dressed as Chicago police officers, stormed into a North Side Street garage and ordered seven members of the North Side Gang against a wall where they were gunned down. The only member to survive, Peter Gusenburg, died hours later at a nearby Chicago hospital refusing to name his attackers. Known as the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, the attack effectively ends the five year gang war between Al Capone and Bugs Moran.

Aftermath.
Although Moran had survived the attempt on his life, as had Torrio only years before, much of the gangs veteran gunmen were killed in the attack. The North Side Gang still held control over the 42nd and 43rd Wards, and although an attempt would be made to hold their territory against rivals such as Frank McErlane in 1930, the power of the North Side Gang slowly declined during the early 1930's. It was later suspected Moran was part of the gunmen who killed Jack McGurn, organizer of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, in 1936. However, Moran was powerless to stop the National Crime Syndicates takeover of the North Side's gambling operations, the organizations only remaining source of income following the end of Prohibition, and by the end of the decade Moran had left the Chicago underworld leaving the North Side territory to be absorbed into the Chicago Outfit.

<doc id="5268509" title="Dead Moon (game)" nonfiltered="38" processed="38" dbindex="1480037">


Dead Moon (     - Tsuki Sekai no Akumu in Japan) is the title of a video game released for the TurboGrafx-16. It was developed and published by Natsume Inc. and released on February 22, 1991 in Japan and later in 1991 in the United States. It is a side scrolling action shooter with the player piloting a space ship in order to stop an alien infestation of the Moon. The game starts out on Earth but then sends the player into outer space to combat the attack.

Storyline.
200 years after man began exploration of the solar system, an event occurred. A comet was detected near Pluto that was entering our system and approaching Earth. It was calculated to miss the planet by 1.2 billion kilometers. As probes were sent to monitor the comet, the comet sought them out and destroyed them, after which it set its course directly for Earth. The UN scrambled to avert certain distaster by sending out orbit shifting (ATFI) missiles to stop the comet. Upon their impact, the comet's course changed and it crashed into the Moon. When probes were sent to inspect the damage, what they found was a host of alien military space crafts.

Gameplay.
The game starts off with two ships in reserve and three cluster bombs. The spaceship moves left-to-right, with the screen being at rest only at certain areas, such as boss battles. Periodically during enemy barriages, supply ships will enter the screen near the top or bottom and, if shot, will release upgrades. Multiple pickups of the same color/upgrade will increase the potentcy of the weapon to a maximum of three and allow the ship to take one more extra hit per pickup to a maximum of three. With each hit, the ship will lose one level of weapon increase and once the ship is at its base weapon level, it will be destroyed on the next hit. If the ship gains a certain color/upgrade once it has reached its three upgrade limit, the ship will gain one cluster bomb per pickup. There are six levels (called scenes), each with a mid-level boss and scene boss.
Weapon upgrades.

Circular spreader - red - This upgrade enable the ship to shoot out circular energy clusters in a wide area. As multiple red canisters are picked up, this area increases.
Laser beam - blue - Three laser beams fire from the craft and rotate around in the air towards the other end of the screen. As multiple blue canisters are picked up, the number of beams increases as well as the area the beams cover.
Waves - green - An upgrade that provides laser beams that looks like waves. As multiple green canisters are picked up, the wave increases in width.
Standard spreader - yellow - This is a modification of the standard weapon, increasing the weapon range diagonally in a spread-like area. As multiple yellow canisters are picked up, the spreader area increases and also shoots out the rear of the ship.
Ship upgrades.
Homing missile - This upgrade adds homing missiles being deployed ever time the regular gun is fired. They appear from the top and bottom of the craft. With each multiple pickup, the number of missiles and their frequency increases.
Defensive orbs - This upgrade provides the ship with orb-like objects that can take hits unharmed. With each multiple pickup, the number of orbs increases and they will start to rotate instead of being stationary.
Levels.

 City - first level - The game starts with the ship over a city skyline, where the aliens have begun to invade. The mid-level bosses here are two typical looking flying saucers. At the end of the level is a giant skeleton bird whose weak spot is its heart. Once this creature is defeated, the ship blasts off to the Moon in the background.
 Space - second level - This level takes you from just outside the atmosphere of Earth to the Moon. Along the way, the ship has to contend with asteroids and space debris as well as the alien ships. The mid-level bosses are F-15-looking ships. At the end of the level is a giant turtle that recedes in its shell in order to bounce around the screne at the ship. It also breathes fire.
 Moon - third level - The next scene takes place on the surface of the Moon. As the ship skims the surface, alien enemies both on the ground and above it attack. The mid-level boss here is a large battle space ship. The boss at the end of the level is a skeleton of a Tyrannosaurus. Similar to the first level boss, its weak spot is also its heart.
 Cave - fourth level - Upon beating the boss on the Moon surface, the ship descends into a crater. Inside is a cave with a river, which the ship parallels. The mid-level boss, which shows up twice in the level, is a ship that is similar in style to a shellfish. It opens and closes to shoot at the ship. The boss at the end of the level is a bi-pedal bird similar to an ostrich. After defeating it, the ship lowers into the river.
 Lake - fifth level - Inside the lake, aquatic looking alien ships attack the ship. The mid-level boss is a Robotic woman jutting out of a snail shell. The level boss is a giant skeletal fish that swims back and forth from either side of the screen. From this battle, the ship approaches the surface of the water.
 Core - sixth level - Now in the core of the Moon, the ship must face the true alien enemies, which now come fast and furious. There is no mid-level boss, just a three part final boss battle. It starts with two skeletal hands that try to grab at the ship. Once these are defeated, they retreat and join with the rest of the skeletal human-like body, which spews flames. Once this part is defeated, the final part is the head of the creature, which can call forth four other duplicate heads to rotate around it. Once it is defeated, the game credits roll and the player starts the game over on a higher difficulty level where enemies need to take twice as much damage in order to be destroyed.

Monster-in-Law is a 2005 romantic comedy film, directed by Robert Luketic. It marks a return to cinema for Jane Fonda; her first film in 15 years. The screenplay is written by Anya Kochoff. The original music score is composed by David Newman and Rosey.

Tagline 1: She met the perfect man. Then she met his mother.
Tagline 2: This relationship is going to be a real mother.

Plot summary.

Charlie Cantilini (played by Jennifer Lopez) is a dogwalker from Venice Beach, California, who meets surgeon Kevin Fields (played by Michael Vartan). Kevin asks her out, and Charlie believes that she's finally found the right man.

Things start to go wrong when Kevin introduces Charlie to his mother, Viola Fields (played by Jane Fonda). Viola has recently been replaced as a newscaster for someone younger, and is in meltdown. Loathing Charlie from the outset, and fearing that she'll lose her son the same way she lost her career, she decides to destroy her son's relationship. With her trusted assistant, Ruby (played by Wanda Sykes) who is secretly working against her, she tries everything possible to drive Charlie away but she does not succeed until Kevin and Charlie's wedding day. Viola turns up wearing a white dress. Charlie decides to back down as she cannot take living life with her mother-in-law trying to destroy her relationship. Then Viola's own dreadful mother-in-law, Gertrude, appears and they have an argument. Gertrude bears a strong resemblance to Viola. It is then after the argument that Viola realises that she wants Charlie to stay, and they reconcile.

 Reaction.
The movie was generally panned by critics (, ), but the $43-million movie became a box-office success, earning $83 million ($153.8 worldwide)  during its theatrical run in summer 2005. This was considered good news for Jennifer Lopez, for this is her second box-office hit (the previous one was  2004's Shall We Dance?) following the notorious failure Gigli (2003). It was also good for Jane Fonda, since it was her first film since 1990's Stanley and Iris, and the two actresses were among the film's strongest points.

James Tully (18 September 1915 - 20 May 1992) was a prominent Irish trade unionist, politician and Deputy Leader of the Irish Labour Party who served as a minister in a series of Irish Fine Gael-Labour coalition governments.

James (Jim) Tully was born in Carlanstown, near Kells in County Meath. He was educated in Carlanstown NS and in St. Patrick's Classical School in Navan. He served as TD for Meath from 1954-1957 and from 1961-1982. When Labour entered into a coalition government with Fine Gael in 1973, he was appointed Minister for Local Government. In that role he became famous for two things; a massive increase in the building of public housing and an attempt to gerrymander Irish constituencies to ensure the re-election of the National Coalition in the 1977 general election. His attempt, which came to be called a Tullymander, backfired spectacularly and helped engineer a landslide for the opposition.

Tully was appointed Deputy Leader of Labour under Michael O'Leary in 1981, and was appointed Minister for Defence in the shortlived 1981-82 Fine Gael-Labour government. He suffered a shrapnel injury to his face when, while attending a military parade in Cairo as a guest of President Anwar Sadat, Sadat, whom Tully was beside, was assassinated.

Tully retired from politics in 1982.

Publius Petronius Turpilianus was a Roman politician and general.

He was consul in AD 61, but in the second half of that year he laid down that office and was appointed governor of Britain, replacing Gaius Suetonius Paulinus who had been removed from office in the wake of the rebellion of Boudica. In contrast to Suetonius's punitive measures, Petronius took a conciliatory approach, and conducted few military operations. In 63 he was replaced by Marcus Trebellius Maximus, and was appointed curator aquarum (superintendent of aqueducts) in Rome.

In 65 he was given a triumph, apparently for his loyalty to the emperor Nero. Following Nero's death in 68, Servius Sulpicius Galba, governor of Hispania Tarraconensis, was named Emperor by the Senate. During his march from Spain to Rome, Galba had Petronius summarily executed (or ordered him to take his own life) as a commander appointed by Nero.

He was the (adopted?) son of Publius Petronius and Plautia, sister of Aulus Plautius, the conqueror and first governor of Britain.

<doc id="5953647" title="Revenue-cap regulation" nonfiltered="44" processed="44" dbindex="1480043">


Revenue-cap regulation regulation is a system for setting the prices charged by regulated monopolies. It is contrasted with rate-of-return regulation, in which utilities are permitted a set rate of return on capital, and with price-cap regulation where total revenue is the regulated variable.

As with price-cap regulation, the system  uses "CPI - X", or, in the United Kingdom "RPI-X"   to set revenue caps. This takes the rate of inflation, measured by the Consumer Price Index (UK Retail Price Index, RPI) and subtracts expected efficiency savings X.  The system is intended to provide incentives for efficiency savings, as any savings above the predicted rate X can be passed on to shareholders, at least until the price caps are next reviewed (usually every five years). A key part of the system is that the rate X is based not only a firm's past performance, but on the performance of other firms in the industry: X is intended to be a proxy for a competitive market, in industries which are natural monopolies.

The choice of a revenue-cap rather than a price cap means that the regulated enterprise does not face any quantity risk. This may be appropriate in cases, such as electricity distribution, where the quantity demanded is largely outside the control of the regulated firm, and where costs may be insensitive to short-term variations in quantity demanded.

In practice, the distinction between revenue-cap and rate-of-return regulation may be lost, as regulators may end up making implicit decisions on the acceptable real rates of return on capital employed in order to arrive at price limit determinations.

Mount Guiting-Guiting is saw-tooth shaped mountain located in the heart of Sibuyan Island, one of the seven islands of Romblon Province in the Philippines. Guiting-Guiting, in the local dialect means "jagged", which explains the name of the mountain. 

In May 1982, under the leadership of Arturo T. Valdez, a joint team from the Bacolod-based Philippine Mountaineering Society (PMS) and the University of the Philippines (UP)-Mountaineers arrived in the small town of Magdiwang in the island of Sibuyan, Romblon.

With the kind cooperation of Hon. Don Morgado, then Mayor of Magdiwang, the team assaulted the mountain- the attempt of which was to be the first in the history of Romblon Province.

It was during this expedition that one of the peaks, now known as "Mayo's Peak" was named after one of the team members, Mayo Monteza, who celebrated his birthday during the climb, while one of the water spring sources now known as "Bulod's Spring" was named after one of the local guides, Bulod, who volunteered (along with another local)to join the climb.  
The team failed to take the summit on this first attempt, but came back two weeks after to finally make the final conquest.  

In the first week of June of 1982, four climbers became the first to stand at the summit of Mt. Guiting-Guiting.  

They were: Mon Ruiz; Kim Valino; Bubot Tan Torre; (all of UP Mountaineers) and Edwin Gatia of the PMS team.

For the first time in Philippine mountaineering history, a first ascent was attempted and successfully accomplished at the seemingly invulnerable and formidable Mt. Guiting-Guiting.

The Cruces River (spanish: Río Cruces) is an important river near Valdivia, Chile. Río Cruces originates from some hills near Villarica volcano and then flows southward. The southern and final part of the river follows the Valdivian Coastal Range. At the latitude of Valdivia it becames part of the Valdivia  River. The small village of Punucapa is the main centre for tourism in Río Cruces.

History.

From the beginnings the river was used by the indians to transport food for commerce. In its early days the city of Valdivia received vegetables from villages via the Cruces River. Before Valdivia became isolated from the rest of the Spanish empire due to the Arauco War, its main land route (Camino Real in spanish)  to Concepcion was drawn following the Cruces river. The river is home to thousands of birds that live in its wetlands. The wetlands were created when the soil that surrounded the river sunk during the Great Chilean Earthquake. The most known bird of the place is the Black-necked Swan. In 2004 a pulp mill opened near San José de la Mariquina, and begun to contaminate the wetlands of the river.

<doc id="5565608" title="Archdiocese of Valencia" nonfiltered="48" processed="48" dbindex="1480047">
The Archdiocese of Valencia (Latin, Valentina) is a Roman Catholic ecclesiastical territory located in north-eastern Spain, in the province of Valencia, part of the autonomous community of Valencia.  The archdiocese heads the ecclesiastical province of Valencia, having Metropolitan authority over the suffragan dioceses of Ibiza, Mallorca, Minorca, Orihuela-Alicante and Segorbe-Castellón.

 Overview .
Diocese created in Roman times, Pope Innocent VIII elevated it to an archdiocese in 1492.


The cathedral in the early days of the Reconquest was called Iglesia Mayor, then Seo (Sedes), and at the present time, in virtue of the papal concession of 16 October, 1866, it is called the Basilica metropolitana.  It is situated in the centre of the ancient Roman city where some believe the temple of Diana stood.  In Gothic times it seems to have been dedicated to the most Holy Saviour; the Cid dedicated it to the Blessed Virgin; king Jaime the Conqueror did likewise, leaving in the main chapel the image of the Blessed Virgin which he carried with him and which is believed to be the one which is now preserved in the sacristy.  The Moorish mosque, which had been converted into a Christian church by the conqueror, appeared unworthy of the title of the cathedral of Valencia, and in 1262 Bishop Andrés de Albalat laid the cornerstone of the new Gothic building, with three naves; these reach only to the choir of the present building.  Bishop Vidal de Blanes built the magnificent chapter hall, and Jaime de Aragón added the tower, called "Miguelete" because it was blessed on St. Michael's day (1418), which is about 166 feet high and finished at the top with a belfry.  

In the fifteenth century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance.  Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the over-ornate style of that decadent period.  At the beginning of the eighteenth century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the façade of the main entrance.  The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the fourteenth century, the other is that of the Paláu.  The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height.  The eighteenth century-restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls.  The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows.  There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the presbyterium. It contains many paintings by eminent artists.  A magnificent silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a very beautiful little Renaissance chapel built by Pope Callixtus III.  Beside the cathedral is the chapel dedicated to the Virgen de los desamparados.

In 1409 a hospital was founded and placed under the patronage of Santa María de los Inocentes; to this was attached a confraternity devoted to recovering the bodies of the unfriended dead in the city and within a radius of three miles around it. At the end of the fifteenth century this confraternity separated from the hospital, and continued this work under the name of Cofradía para el amparo de los desamparados.  King Philip IV and the Duke de Arcos suggested the building of the new chapel, and in 1647 the Viceroy Conde de Orpesa, who ad been preserved from the bubonic plague, insisted on carrying out their project.  The Blessed Virgin under the title of Virgen de los desamparados was proclaimed patroness of the city, and Archbishop Pedro de Urbina y Montoya, on 31 June, 1652, laid the corner-stone of the new chapel of this name.

The Archiepiscopal Palace, a grain market in the time of the Moors, is simple in design, with an inside cloister and a handsome chapel. In 1357 the arch which connects it with the cathedral was built. In the council chamber are preserved the portraits of all the prelates of Valencia. 

Among the parish churches those deserving special mention are:
 Sts. John (Baptist and Evangelist), rebuilt in 1368, whose dome, decorated by Palonino, contains some of the best frescoes of Spain.
 The Temple (El Templo), the ancient church of the Knights Templar, which passed into the hands of the Order of Montessa and which was rebuilt in the reigns of Ferdinand VI and Charles III.
 The former convent of the Dominicans, at present the headquarters of the capital general, the cloister of which has a beautiful Gothic wing and the chapter room, large columns imitating palm trees.
 The Colegio del Corpus Christi, which is devoted to the exclusive worship of the Blessed Sacrament, and in which perpetual adoration is carried on.
 The Jesuit college, which was destroyed (1868) by the revolutionary Committee, but rebuilt on the same site.
 The Colegio de San Juan (also of the Society), the former college of the nobles, now a provincial institute for secondary instruction. ;

The Seminary was built in 1831; from 1790 it was situated at he former house of studies of the Jesuits. Since the Concordat of 1851 it ranks as a central seminary with the faculty of conferring academic degrees.

There have been in Valencia, since very remote times, schools founded by the bishops and directed by ecclesiastics.  In 1412 a studium generale with special statutes was established. Pope Alexander VI raised it to the rank of a university on 23 January, 1500.  King Ferdinand the Catholic confirmed this two years later.  In 1830 the building was reconstructed; a statute of Luis Vivés adorns the corridor.

Among the hospitals and charitable institutions may be mentioned:
 The Casa de Misericordia.
 The Provincial hospital.
 The orphan asylum of San Vicente.
 The Infant Asylum of the Marqués de Campo.

In Gandia there was a university, and the palace of St. Francis Borgia, now the novitiate of the Society of Jesus, is preserved.

 History .
Roman period (until the 5th century):.

The city of Valencia is in the region known in ancient days as Edetania. Florus says that Junius Brutus, the conqueror of Viriathus, transferred thither (140 B.C.) the soldiers who had fought under the latter. Later it was a Roman military colony. In punishment for its adherence to Sertorius it was destroyed by Pompey, but was later rebuilt, and Pomponius Mela says that it was one of the principal cities of Hispania Tarraconensis. 

Nothing positive is known about the introduction of Christianity into Valencia, but at the beginning of the fourth century when Dacianus brought the martyrs St. Valerius, Bishop of Saragossa, and his deacon, St. Vincent of Huesca, to Valencia, the Christians seem to have been numerous. St. Vincent suffered martyrdom at Valencia; the faithful obtained possession of his remains, built a temple over the spot on which he died, and there invoked his intercession.

Visigoth period (5th to 7th centuries):.

The first historically known Bishop of Valencia is Justinianus (531-546), mentioned by St. Isidore in his Viri illustres. Justinianus wrote Responsiones, a series of replies to a certain Rusticus.

Bishops of Valencia assisted at the various councils of Toledo. Witisclus, present at the Sixteenth Council of Toledo (693), was the last bishop before the Mohammedan invasion.

Muslim period (ca. 712-1238):.

Abdelazid, son of Muzza, took the city in ca. 712 and, breaking the terms of surrender, pillaged it; he turned the churches into mosques, leaving only one to the Christians. This was without doubt the present Church of San Bartolomé or that of San Vincente de la Roqueta. 

Valencia was in the power of the Moors for more than five centuries.

It is said that at the time of the Moorish invasion the people of Valencia placed the body of St. Vincent in a boat and that the boat landed on the cape which is now called San Vincente. The King of Portugal, Alfonso Enriquez, found the body and transferred it to Lisbon.

The Cid (Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar) reconquered Valencia for the first time on 15 June, 1094, turned nine mosques into churches, and installed as bishop the French monk Jérôme. On the death of the Cid (July, 1099), his wife, Doña Ximena, retained power for two years, when Valencia was besieged by the Almoravids; although the king Alfonso VI of Castile drove them from the city, he was not strong enough to hold it. The Christians set fire to it, abandoned it, and the Almoravid Masdali took possession of it on 5 May, 1109.

Diocese of Valencia (1238-1492):.

Jaime the Conqueror, with an army composed of French, English, Germans, and Italians, laid siege to Valencia in 1238, and on 28 September of that year forced a surrender. 50,000 Moors left the city and on 9 October the king, followed by his retinue and army, took possession. The principal mosque was purified, Mass was celebrated, and the Te Deum sung.

The see was re-established, ten parishes being formed in the city; the Knights Templar and Hospitallers who had helped in the conquest, also Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians, Mercedarians, and Cistercians, opened houses. The Church of San Vincente outside the walls was rebuilt and beside it a hospital. 

The consecration of the Dominican Berenguer de Castellbisbal, bishop-elect of the See of Valencia after the reconquest, was prevented because of the dispute between the Archbishops of Toledo and Tarragona for jurisdiction over the new see. Pope Gregory IX decided in favour of Tarragona, and, as Berenguer had been appointed Bishop of Gerona in the meantime, Ferrer de San Martín, provost of Tarragona (1239-43), was appointed Bishop of Valencia.

He was succeeded by the Aragónese Arnau de Peralta (1243-48) who drove the Bishop of Segovia, Pedro Garcés, from his see. The third Bishop of Valencia, the Dominican Andrés Albalat (1248-76), founder of the Carthusian monastery, began the construction of the cathedral; this was continued and finished by his successors: Gasperto de Botonach, Abbot of San Felin (1276-88); the Aragónese Dominican, Raimundo de Pont (1288-1312); the Catalonian Raimundo Gastón (1312-48); Hugo de Fenolet, formerly Bishop of Vich (1348-56); and Vidal de Blanes (1356-69).

Jaime de Aragón, Bishop of Tortosa and first cousin of king Pedro IV, succeeded to the see in 1369. Hitherto the chapter had elected the bishops, but owing to the dissensions at the death of Bishop Vidal de Blanes, Pope Urban IV reserved the right to name the bishops until 1523, when the right of presentation was granted to the Spanish kings.

At the death of Jaime de Aragón (1396), the antipope Benedict XIII kept the see vacant for more than two years, and then appointed Hugo de Lupia, Bishop of Tortosa (1398-1427).

He was succeeded by Alfonso de Borja (then Pope Callixtus III). The latter appointed Rodrigo de Borja (then Pope Alexander VI) to the See of Valencia.

Archdiocese of Valencia (since 1492):. 

Rodrigo de Borja obtained from Pope Innocent VIII the rank of metropolitan for his see (1492) and, after he was raised to the papacy (Pope Alexander VI), confirmed this decree. He also raised the studium generale of Valencia to the rank of a university, conferring upon it all the privileges possessed by other universities.

César Borgia bore the title of Archbishop of Valencia, and was succeeded by Juan de Borja y Llansol, Pedro Luis de Borja, and Alfonso de Aragón, illegitimate son of Ferdinand the Catholic and also Archbishop of Saragossa (1512-1520). 

The episcopate of the Augustinian St. Thomas of Villanova (1544-55), founder of the Colegio de la Presentación de Nuestra Señora, called also Colegio de Santo Tomás, was one of the most notable in the history of Valencia. St. Thomas was beatified (1619) by Pope Paul V, and canonized (1658) by Pope Alexander VII. His successors, Francisco de Navarra and Martín Pérez de Ayala, who attended the Council of Trent, were also men of distinction.

Perhaps the most noted of all the archbishops of Valencia was the Patriarch Juan de Ribera (1569-1611). He decided to expel the Moors from the city, after exhausted all possible means to bring them to submission. He founded the Colegio de Corpus Christi and furthered the work of monastic reform, especially among the Capuchins, whom he had brought to Valencia.

Many holy men shed lustre upon this era, including St. Louis Bertram, the Franciscan Nicolás Factor, the Carmelite Francisco de Niño Jesús, and the Minim Gaspar Bono. The archbishop and inquisitor general, Juan Tomás Rocaberti, publicly punished the Governor of Valencia for interfering in ecclesiastical jurisdiction. Andrés Mayoral Alonso de Mella (1738-69) improved the system of charities and public instruction, founded the Colegio de las Escuelas Pías, and the Casa de Enseñanza for girls. He collected a library of 12,000 volumes; this was burnt in the War of Independence. The See of Valencia has had two cardinals, Mariano Barrio y Fernández and Monescillo y Sancho.

Voice chat is a modern form of communication used on the Internet. The means of communicating with voice chat is through any of the messengers, mainly Yahoo!, AOL or MSN Messenger. Voice chat has led to a significant increase in distant communications where two people from opposite ends of the world can talk almost free of cost.

Rocket Messenger and AOL were among the first to offer voice chat facilities. They were followed by Paltalk which became a quick hit.  Later Yahoo! Messenger became the most dominant voice chat service as it provided unique features.  These included individual voice chat with another person, as well as voice chat facilities categorized in Yahoo! Rooms.

Many video games with online multiplayer allow players to communicate via voice chatting. In 2001, Sony released the Network adapter for their PlayStation 2 video game console, which allowed voice chatting with a headset. In 2002, Microsoft launched the Xbox Live service, which supports voice chatting through a headset bundled with the Xbox 360 premium package and the official starter kit. In 2005, Nintendo launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, an online multiplayer service for both the Nintendo DS and the upcoming Wii. In March 2006, Metroid Prime: Hunters was released, making it the first game to allow voice chatting through the Nintendo DS's microphone.

Written in 2005, Moscow, 
 Rough Draft is a fantasy novel of a "parallel world" genre. by Sergey Lukyanenko

Plot introduction.
The story features a Moscow person Kirril, who one day discover that he has the ability to go to other parallel world of the Earth we are living.
 
Plot summary.

The story starts with the hero, Kirril, being "erased" from daily life in present Moscow. Everybody forget him (even his parents and dog), other person lives in his apartment, all IDs and files in all offices disappear. After a while he is phoned and proposed to go in an old water tower   but inside is his future home and working place. There he was revealed that he is able to open doors, leading to other worlds   although at first all but one are locked. After first opened each door becomes rigidly connected to some world, but which one can't be said before. All of worlds have mostly similar environment and seem to be on the planet Earth but societies and people are different.

After a while Kirril met a special group of functionals, called so because they gained supernatural abilities making them excellent in some profession . They serve other people, but mostly other functionals. They say Kirril has become one of them   a customs officer. He benefits from taxes paid by people who pass through his tower. Also he holds a superhuman strength and is almost immortal, but only within some range (10 km) from his tower.

Kirril enjoys new worlds, people and abilities. A politician Dima meets him and asks to find a national idea for Russia. He informs Kirril about the world number One, which nobody can access and which seems to be exactly our world living 30 years later. Critical information from this world may enhance the prestige of the country.

Kirril also encounters underground, that is few people fighting against 'corporate laws' of functionals and their working for themselves or elites of worlds. But he remains untouched by rhetorics of the underground, justifying most of this. Ideas of armed opposition are alien if not to say ridicilous for him. But a younger 20-aged girl who Kirril fell in love with is a genuine underground activist...

The last door opened leads to the world number one: A lovely Moscow filled with smiling people; there were no Second World War and no horrors of revolution, due to this world lags for 30 years and rulers of it carefully study mistakes of others. It's just what Dima proposed to Kirril, but applied reversly.

Upon rather bloody returning to our world, Kirril faces troubles with his girl. Hating system of functionals, she manifests disobedience. But their laws don't forgive this, and functioner Natalie murders her, Kirril being unable to resurrect her...

"An extreme foolishness," said I, "All these loud words and beautiful poses... 'they will not pass', 'yet it moves', 'motherland or death', 'am able to die for my beliefs'   all of this becomes nonsense when real death comes... All of this is for kids. And for adults who handle them...";
Natalie nodded with approval.;
"But yet it moves" said I, "Doesn't it? It moves, and they will not pass, and motherland remains motherland even if death becomes death, and nobody is ready to die, but sometimes it's easier to die than to betray...";

In Kirril's fighting Natalie, his tower became devastated, this ceased his being a functional and restored his former life. The ending of this story we will learn from the second book of the future duology.

Lopoliths are generally concordant with the intruded strata with dike or funnel-shaped feeder bodies below the body. The term was first defined and used by Frank Fitch Grout during the early 1900s in describing the Duluth gabbro complex in northern Minnesota and adjacent Ontario.

Lopoliths typically consist of large ultramafic to mafic layered intrusions that range in age from Archean to Eocene. Examples include the Duluth gabbro, the Sudbury intrusion of Ontario, the Bushveld igneous complex of South Africa, the Skaergaard complex of Greenland and the Humboldt lopolith of Nevada. The Sudbury and Bushveld occurrences have been attributed to impact events and associated crustal melting.

The 21st SS Division Skanderbeg was a Waffen SS Mountain division set up by Heinrich Himmler in March 1944, officially under the title of the 21st Waffen-Gebirgs Division der SS Skanderbeg (albanische Nr. 1). It was named after George Kastrioti Skanderbeg, a national hero of Albanians who resisted Ottoman invasion for 25 years.

Formation.

The names of 11,398 recruits were submitted to Berlin. Of these, 9,275 were deemed suitable for drafting, and 6,491 were actually drafted into the Waffen SS. The final division was formed up by these recruits, three hundred ethnic Albanians transferred from the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar and some German veterans from Austria and Volksdeutsche officers, NCOs and enlisted men. The final total strength of the division was at 8,500 to 9,000 men, consisting of two infantry regiments, a single artillery regiment, a reconnaissance battalion, a mountain combat engineer battalion, a signals battalion and an anti-tank battalion. 

Many Albanians in Kosovo saw the invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia by Axis Powers as an opportunity to secede from the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes (who treated Albanians as second class citizens in the kingdom ), and eventually merge with Albania. In 1941 Albania, Western Macedonia, and majority of Kosovo were under Italian control. Following the surrender of Fascist Italy in 1943, the territories under discussion, inhabited largely by Albanians were occupied by Nazi Germany. The 21st Waffen SS Mountain Division was the only fully ethnic Albanian division to be recruited during the Second World War. It was established originally to combat partisans with the promise that the territories with a majority Albanian population were to become an independent and unified state to include Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia or what Albanian nationalists called  natural Albania  or "Great Albania".

The division was placed under the command of SS-Standartenfuhrer August Schmidhuber, later promoted to SS-Oberfuhrer. It fought partisans who were on the increase and consolidating their actions, both in Albania and Yugoslavia as the Second World War was drawing to an end. In Kosovo, the division embarked on ethnic cleansing of the Serbs, especially those who were previously settled in Kosovo through agrarian reform and colonization of Kosovo with Serbs and Montenegrins, through the program the Kingdom of Yugoslavia implemented from 1918-1941. At least 75,000 Serbs fled Kosovo during the pursecution while around 10,000 Serbs lost their lives during the ethnic cleansing.

In Kosovo, Albanian families worked to save Jews , although not all Jews survived. On the eve of World War II there were 520 Jews living in Kosovo, but during WWII, the Albanian Waffen SS Skanderbeg division were responsible for turning over some 210 Jews in Kosovo to the Gestapo, who shipped them to concentration camps. Nevertheless, the highest Jewish survival rate in ex-Yugoslavia during WWII was in Kosovo, with some 62% percent of Jews surviving.

The life of SS Skanderbeg from its establishment to surrender and dissolution was approximately one year (March 1944   March 1945). The division began disintegrating as early as October 1944 when the Germans began withdrawing from the area and partisans were closing in. By the end of November, 3,500 members of the division had  deserted from its ranks. Whatever remained of the division was reorganized into the 21st SS Mountain Skanderbeg Division, concentrated at Skopje, leading to its defense, alongside the Prinz Eugen Division, of the Vardar River valley in Macedonia, allowing German General Alexander Lohr's Army Group E to retreat from Greece. By January 1945, a group of the Skanderbeg Division retreated to Kosovka Mitrovica in Kosovo and then to Brcko in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They finally reached Austria in May, 1945, and fought until Germany's surrender. The division surrendered to Western Allied personnel. The remainders were scattered in many directions. A small number went into hiding and melted away with the population and survived. Some managed to emigrate as civilians to Western countries and a few reached even Australia. Many of the remainders, however, were executed by the partisans (communists).

SS-Brigadef hrer August Schmidthuber, one of the commanders of the 21st SS Mountain Division "Skanderbeg , was captured in 1945 and turned over to Yugoslav authorities. He was put on trial in February 1947 by a Yugoslav military tribunal at Belgrade, on charges of participating in massacres, deportations and atrocities against civilians. The tribunal sentenced him to death by hanging. He was executed on February, 27th 1947. (History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War p. 528, United Nations War Crimes Commission, London: HMSO, 1948).

The division arm patch consisted of a black double-headed eagle on a red background. Albanian recruits wore a white fez-style cap, and later the SS issued grey headgear in the same style, with the Totenkopf sewn on the front.

The duo of Pete and Geoff were DJs Pete Mitchell and Geoff Lloyd, who from January 2003 to December 2005 hosted the breakfast show on Virgin Radio. In the early 1980's, Mitchell was an aspiring musician who moved into management and production. In 1988 he joined Manchester's Piccadilly Radio and went on to be an enthusiastic champion of indie bands of the "Madchester" scene in the early nineties. He was introduced to Geoff Lloyd around this time. Lloyd was an aspiring comedy writer and performer, and a fellow radio presenter. In 1996 they were asked by Key 103 to co-present their afternoon show.

The duo rapidly established a cult following with their witty and slightly risque banter, and in 1998 won a Sony radio academy award for their show. They were subsequently recruited by Virgin Radio and again rapidly built up a significant audience for their Drivetime Show. By 2003 they were the most popular DJs on the station and were moved to the Breakfast Show in order to increase the audience. This they did very successfully, sticking to their well-established formula of slightly risque banter about contemporary news and culture, with Mitchell tending to play the "straight man" to the more outrageous Lloyd. Lloyd occasionally courted controversy with some of his remarks, most notoriously when he expressed willingness to eat the limbs of a dead baby to ease poverty. A complaint against the station was upheld and Lloyd was reprimanded for his comments. Nevertheless, the audience for the show remained strong, despite (or possibly because) of Lloyd's willingness to stray to the edge of acceptability with his remarks.

On 28 November 2005, to the dismay of their listeners, the duo announced that they were splitting up and leaving the Breakfast Show on Virgin Radio.  Their final show together took place on 16 December.  Geoff Lloyd remained at Virgin Radio, hosting the Late Show, whilst Pete Mitchell left the station to pursue other projects.  Christian O'Connell, from the Breakfast Show on XFM London replaced the pair as host of the Breakfast Show.

Geoff appeared on the Channel 4 show Richard & Judy on Thursday 8th December 2005 to celebrate the life of former Beatle, John Lennon.

The Comstock Lode is the richest known U.S. deposit of silver ore discovered under what is now Virginia City, Nevada on the eastern slope of Mt. Davidson, a peak in the Virginia range. After the discovery was made public in 1859, prospectors rushed to the area and mining camps in the vicinity, which became thriving centers of fabulous wealth. The excavations were carried to depths of more than 3200 feet (1000 meters), until the inflow of hot water brought operations to a halt. Between 1859 and 1878, it yielded $400 million in silver and gold, equivalent to approximately $500-600 billion dollars in 2005, as a relative share of GDP.  It is notable not just for the immense fortunes it generated and the large role those fortunes had in the growth of Nevada and San Francisco, but also for the advances in mining technology that it spurred. Exhaustion of the mines by wasteful and intensive exploitation started a decline about 1874 that ended in the abandonment of the lode in 1898.

 The discovery of silver .
The discovery of silver in Nevada in 1858 (then Western Utah Territory), caused considerable excitement in California and throughout the United States.  The excitement was one not seen since the discovery of gold in California ten years earlier.  According to Dan De Quille, a journalist of the period "the discovery of silver undoubtedly deserves to rank in merit above the discovery of the gold mines of California, as it gives value to a much greater area of territory and furnishes employment to a much larger number of persons".

Gold was discovered in this region in the spring of 1850.  It was discovered in Gold Canyon, by a company of Mormon emigrants on their way to the California Gold Rush. After arriving too early to cross the Sierra, they camped on the Carson river in the vicinity of Dayton, Nevada, to wait for the mountain snow to melt.  They soon found gold along the gravel river banks by panning, but left when the mountains were passable, as they anticipated taking out more gold on reaching California.  Other emigrants followed, camped on the canyon and went to work at mining.  However, when the supply of water in the canyon gave out toward the end of summer, they continued across the mountains to California.  The camp had no permanent population until the winter and spring of 1852-53, when there were 200 men at work along the gravel banks of the canyon with rockers, Long Toms and sluices.

The gold from Gold Canyon came from quartz veins, toward the head of the vein, in the vicinity of where Silver City and Gold Hill now stand.  As the miners worked their way up the stream, they founded the town of Johntown on a plateau.  In 1857, the Johntown miners found gold in Six-Mile Canyon, which is about five miles North of Gold Canyon.  Both of these canyons are on what is now known as the Comstock Lode.  The early miners never thought of going up to the head of the ravines to prospect the quartz veins, spending their time on the "free" gold in the lower elevation surface deposits of earth and gravel.

Credit for the discovery of the Comstock Lode is disputed.  It is said to have been discovered, in 1857, by Ethan Allen Grosh and Hosea Ballou Grosh, sons of a Pennsylvania minister,trained mineralogists and veterans of the California gold fields.  Hosea injured his foot and died of tetanus in 1857.  In an effort to raise funds, Allen and an associate, Richard Burke, set out on a trek to California with samples and maps of their claim.  Henry Thomas Paige Comstock was left in their stead to care for the Grosch cabin and a locked chest containing silver and gold ore samples and documents of the discovery. Grosch and Burke never made it to California, suffering the fate of severe hardship while crossing the Sierran trails.  The two suffered from gangrene and at the hands of a miner-surgeon lost their limbs through amputation, a last ditch effort to save the lives of the pair.  Allen Grosch died on December 19, 1857.  Richard Burke lived, but upon his recovery returned to his home in Canada.

When Henry T. P. Comstock learned of the death of the Grosch brothers, he took it upon himself to claim the cabin and the lands as his own.  He also examined the contents of the trunk but thought nothing of the documents as he was not an educated man.  What he did know is that the gold and the silver ore samples were from the same vein.  He continued to seek out diggings of local miners working in the area as he knew the Grosch brothers' find was still unclaimed.  Upon learning of a strike on Gold Hill which uncovered some bluish rock (Silver Ore), Comstock immediately filed for an unclaimed area directly adjacent to this area.  

The four miners that discovered the Gold Hill outcropping were James Fennimore ("Old Virginny"), John Bishop ("Big French John"), Aleck henderson and Jack Yount.  Their discovery was actually part of the Comstock Lode, but not a main vein.  The four men are therefore credited with the rediscovery of the mine previously found by the Grosch brothers.

 Tragic fates of the discoverers .
Those who discovered the famous mine were ignorant and not well educated in mineral sciences.  The "blue stuff" kept clogging the rockers, and eventually the men grew frustrated and discouraged from their gold mining.

Patrick McLaughlin sold his interest in the Ophir claim for $3,500 which he soon lost.  He then worked as a cook at the Green mine in California.  He died working at odd jobs.

Emanuel Penrod sold his share of the interest for $8,500 .  

Peter O'Riley held on to his interests collecting dividends, until selling for about $40,000.  He erected a stone hotel on B Street in Virginia City called the Virginia House, and became a dealer of mining stocks. He began a tunnel into the Sierras near Genoa, Nevada, expecting to strike a richer vein than the Comstock.  He lost everything, went insane and died in a private asylum in Woodbridge, California.

Comstock traded an old blind horse and a bottle of whiskey for a one-tenth share formerly owned by James Fennimore ("Old Virginny"), but later sold all of his holdings to Judge James Walsh for $11,000 .  He opened trade good stores in Carson City and Silver City.  Having no education and no business experience, he went broke.  After losing all his property and possessions in Nevada, Comstock prospected for some years in Idaho and Montana without success.  In September 1870, while prospecting in Big Horn country, near Bozeman, Montana, he committed suicide with his revolver.

 Early mining and milling .

The ore was first extracted through surface diggings, but these were quickly exhausted and miners had to tunnel underground to reach ore bodies.  Unlike most silver ore deposits, which occur in long thin veins, those of the Comstock Lode occurred in discrete masses often hundreds of feet thick.  The ore was so soft it could be removed by shovel.  Although this allowed the ore to be easily excavated, the weakness of the surrounding material resulted in frequent and deadly cave-ins.

The cave-in problem was solved by the method of square-set timbering invented by Philip Deidesheimer, a German who had been appointed superintendent of the Ophir mine.  Previously timber sets consisting of vertical members on either side of the diggings capped by a third horizontal member used to support the excavation.  However, the Comstock ore bodies were too large for this method.  Instead, as ore was removed it was replaced by timbers set as a cube six feet on a side.  Thus, the ore body would be progressively replaced with a timber lattice.  Often these voids would be re-filled with waste rock from other diggings after ore removal was complete. By this method of building up squares of framed timbers, an ore vein of any width may be safely worked to any height or depth.

Early in the history of Comstock mining, there were heavy flows of water to contend with. This called for pumping machinery and apparatus, and as greater depth was attained, larger pumps were demanded. All the inventive genius of the Pacific Coast was called into play, and this resulted in construction of some of the most powerful and effective steam and hydraulic pumping equipment to be found in any part of the world.  Initially, the water was cold, but the deeper workings cut into parts of the vein where there were heavy flows of hot water.  This water was hot enough to cook an egg or scald a man to death almost instantly. Lives were lost by falling into sumps of this water hot from the vein.  The hot water called for fans, blowers and various kinds of vertilation aparatus, as miners working in heated drifts had to have a supply of cool air.

Compressed air for running power drills and for driving fans and small hoisting engines was adopted in the Comstock mines. Diamond drills for drilling long distances through solid rock were also in general use, but were discarded for prospecting purposes, being found unreliable.  Several new forms of explosives for blasting were also developed.

Great improvements were also made in the hoisting cages used to extract ore and transport the miners to their work. As the depth of the diggings increased, the hemp ropes used to haul ore to the surface became impractical, as their self-weight became a significant fraction of their breaking load.  The solution to this problem came from A. S. Hallidie in 1864 when he developed a flat woven wire rope.  This wire rope went on to be used in San Francisco's famous cable cars.

In 1859 the Americans, as a people, knew nothing about silver mining.  In the California placer mines there were however, a large number of Mexicans, who had worked silver mines in their own country.  Initially, the Comstock miners endeavored to partner with Mexicans, or at least hire a Mexican foreman to take charge of the mine.  The Mexicans adopted their methods of arastras, patios and adobe smelting furnaces to process silver ore.  These methods proved to be too slow for the Americans and could not process the quantities of ore being extracted. The Americans introduced stamp mills for crushing the ore, and pans to hasten the process of amalgamation. The process of amalgamating crushed ore reduced the required days by the patio process, to hours by using steam-heated iron pans. Some of the German miners, who had been educated at the mining academy of Freiberg, were regarded as the best then existing to work with argentiferous ores.  They introduced the barrel process of amalgamation and the roasting of ores.  While the barrel process was an improvement on the patio, it was found not to be well adapted to the rapid working of the Comstock ores as the newly invented pan process. By these efforts it was found that the free milling ores of the Comstock were not required to be roasted.

In the early days of pan processing of ores, there were tremendous losses in precious metals and quicksilver (mercury). Almost every millman was experimenting with some secret process for the amalgamation of ore. They tried all manner of trash, both mineral and vegetable, including concoctions of cedar bark and sagebrush tea. At that time, untold millions in gold, silver and quicksilver were swept away into the rivers with the tailings, as the ore on which these experiments were tried was almost pure silver.  Although many patterns and forms of amalgamating pans were invented and patented, there was much room for improvement. Improvements were made from time to time, resulting in reductions in losses of metals, but none of the apparatus in use on the Comstock was perfect.

 The days of "bull teams" and the Virginia & Truckee Railroad .

Before railroads were built, all freight and passengers were transported by teams of from 10 to 16 horses or mules. Ore was hauled to the mills by these teams, which also brought to the mines all the wood, lumber and timber required. Teams also hauled over the Sierras all the mining machinery, all supplies required by both mines and mills, and goods and merchandise needed by the stores and businesses. Each team hauled trains of from two to four loaded wagons. When the large reduction works of the Ophir Mining Company were in peak operation, lines of teams from one to three miles in length moved along the wagon roads, and sometimes blocked Virginia City streets for hours.

In 1859, 1860 and 1861, great quantities of goods were transported across the Sierras to and from California on the backs of mules. When the Central Pacific Railroad line was completed, this hauling was from Virginia City to Reno via the Geiger grade wagon road, for transfer to rail for delivery to points east and west.

Ground was broken on the Virginia and Truckee Railroad on February 19, 1869 and eight months thereafter, the most difficult section from Virginia City to Carson City was completed. Rails were extended North across the Washoe valley, from Carson City to Reno, where it connects with the Central Pacific.  Between Virginia City and Carson City, at Mound House, the railroad also connects with the Carson and Colorado Railroad.

 The Virginia City and Gold Hill Water Company .

When silver was first discovered on the Comstock, the flow of water from natural springs was adequate to supply the needs of the miners and small towns of Virginia City and Gold Hill, Nevada. As population increased wells were dug for domestic needs, and the water within several mine tunnels was added to the available supply. As the mills and hoisting works multiplied, the demand for water for use in steam boilers became so great that it was impossible to supply it without creating a water shortage among the residents, now thousands in number.  In this need, the Virginia City and Gold Hill Water Company was formed, being the first non-mining incorporation on the Comstock Lode.

Water from wells and tunnels in the surrounding mountains was soon exhausted. It became imperative to look toward the main range of the Sierra Nevada mountains, where there is an inexhaustible supply. Between the Sierra and the Virginia ranges lay the Washoe valley, a great trough nearly 2,000 feet in depth. Herman Schussler, a Swiss trained engineer of great repute who had planned water works in San Francisco, was brought to the Comstock to plan and design the new works. Surveys were made in 1872, the first sections of pipe laid June 11, 1873 and the last on July 25 the same year.

The initial pipe was made of wrought iron, a total length of over 7 miles, with an interior diameter of 12 inches and a capacity of 92,000 gallons per hour. The pipe traversed the Washoe valley in the form of an inverted siphon, and at the lowest point having a pressure of 1,720 feet of water, or 800 pounds per square inch. The inlet being 465 feet above the outlet, the water is forced through the pipe at tremendous pressure.  Water was brought to the inlet in the Sierra Nevada range from sources of supply in two large covered flumes, and at the outlet end of the pipe was delivered in two large flumes a distance of 12 miles to Virginia City. The pipe was constructed of sheets of wrought iron riveted together, each section fastened with three rows of rivets. Lead was used to secure the joints between each pipe section. The first flow of water reached Gold Hill and Virginia City on August 1, 1873 with great fanfare. This accomplishment was the greatest pressurized water system in operation in the world, having superseded the water system at Cherokee Flat, California also designed by Schussler.

The water company laid an additional pipe alongside the first in 1875, and a third pipe in 1877.  These pipes of lap welded joints deliver more water, there being less friction of rivet heads upon the water.  Additional flumes were also constructed to diversify and improve reliability of supply.

 The Sutro Tunnel .

While there was a scarcity of water on the surface, there was an excess of water underground in all the mines. Floods in the mines were sudden and miners narrowly escaped being drowned by vast underground reservoirs that were unexpectedly tapped. Intrusion of scalding-hot water into the mines was a large problem, and the expense of water removal increased as depths increased.  To overcome these troubles, Adolph Sutro conceived the idea of running a drain tunnel under the Comstock Lode from the lowest possible point. A survey was made by Schussler and work commenced in October 1869.  The Sutro Tunnel was completed from the valley near Dayton through nearly four miles of solid rock to meet the Comstock mines approximately 1,650 feet beneath the surface. From the main tunnel, branches were run north and south along the vein a distance of over two miles, connecting to various mines. The tunnel is 16 ft wide and 12 ft high. Drain flumes are sunk in the floor and over these are two tracks for horse carts. It required over eight years to complete construction. The tunnel provide drainage and ventilation for the mines as well as gravity-assisted ore removal.  However, by the time it reached the Comstock area mines, most of the ore above 1,650 feet had already been removed and the lower workings were 1,500 feet deeper still.  Although virtually no ore was removed through the tunnel, the drainage it provided greatly decreased the operating costs of the mines served. The ventilation problems were solved at about the same time by the use of pneumatic drills.

 Big Bonanzas .

Peak production from the Comstock occurred in 1877, with the mines producing over $14,000,000 of gold and $21,000,000 of silver that year.  Production decreased rapidly thereafter, and, by 1880, the Comstock was considered to be played out.  The deepest depth was struck, in 1884, in the Mexican Winze at 3,300 feet below the surface.  Underground mining continued sporadically until 1922, when the last of the pumps was shut off causing the mines to flood. Re-processing of mill tailings continued through the 1920s, and exploration in the area continued through the 1950s.

Nevada is commonly called the "Silver State" on account of the silver produced from the Comstock Lode.  However, since 1878, Nevada has been a relatively minor silver producer, with most subsequent bonanzas consisting of more gold than silver.

 Four Kings .

George Hearst, a highly successful California prospector, became head of Hearst, Haggin, Tevis and Co., the largest private mining firm in the United States, owned and operated the Ophir mine, on the Comstock Lode, as well as other gold and silver mining interests in California, Nevada, Utah, South Dakota and Peru.  Hearst was a member of the California State Assembly and became a United States Senator from California.  George Hearst was the father of the famed newspaperman, William Randolph Hearst.

William Chapman Ralston, founder of the Bank of California, financed a number of mining operations, repossessed some of those mines as their owners defaulted, and ultimately made enormous profits from the Comstock Lode.

William Sharon, a business partner of William Chapman Ralston, was the Nevada agent for the Bank of California, and acquired Ralston's assets when his financial empire collapsed.  William Sharon became the second United States Senator from Nevada.

William M. Stewart, who abandoned mining to become an attorney in Virginia City, Nevada, participated in mining litigation and the development of mining on the Comstock Lode.  As Nevada became a State in 1864, Stewart assisted in developing the State constitution and became the first United States Senator from Nevada.

 History .
Maud is on the St. Louis Southwestern Railway near U.S. Highway 67 ten miles south of Boston and is seventeen miles southwest of Texarkana in southern Bowie County. The territory around Maud, known before the Republic of Texas era as the Red River Country, was among the earliest settled areas, but Spanish claims to the land, outlaws from the Neutral Ground, and general lawlessness discouraged extensive development. After the railroad reached the site in 1870, a community gradually began to emerge. The town was named for Maud Knapp, daughter of Samuel D. Knapp, the first postmaster and the donor of land for the townsite. A post office opened in 1881, closed the next year, then reopened in 1893. By 1910 the population of the town had reached 300, and by 1940 it had grown to 750. During World War II the Red River Army Depot and the Lone Star Army Ammunition Plant were built six miles north of the community. These two facilities provided jobs for many Maud citizens. In 1982 Maud had eleven rated businesses and an estimated population of 1,059. The two military installations remained the largest employers of Maud residents. In 1990 the community population was 1,049.

Education.
The City of Maud is served by the Maud Independent School District.

<doc id="5558649" title=""Dawn-to-dusk" transcontinental flight across the United States" nonfiltered="69" processed="69" dbindex="1480069">
The "Dawn to dusk" transcontinental flight across the United States was a pioneering aviation record established June 23, 1924. It marked the first crossing of the North American continent within the hours of daylight.

The record was set by 1st Lt. Russell L. Maughan, a U.S. Army Air Service test pilot at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio, the site of the Air Service Engineering Division and its major flight-test center.

Concept and flight plan.
The plan for the flight was conceived by the Air Service's Assistant Chief, Brig. Gen. William L. Mitchell in 1923. The Air Service since 1919 had been regularly establishing endurance, distance, altitude and speed records in airplanes to promote favorable publicity and public support for the establishment of an Air Force separate from the U.S. Army. The year before Lt. James H. Doolittle had flown a DH-4 from Florida to San Diego in a single calendar day, making just one stop in Texas for fuel. Mitchell wanted to not only improve on both the time and distance involved, but to have the stunt highly publicized by having it takeoff and land during daylight at major urban centers. The military purpose of the flight would be to demonstrate the utility of rapidly moving air units from one side of the nation to the other, a capability that the Army and Navy did not possess.

The original calculations for the flight were that in early summer, including twilight, 20 hours of daylight were available for the flight. By averaging 160 miles an hour, the distance of 2,670 miles from New York to San Francisco could be covered in 16 hours 40 minutes. Mitchell had struck a deal with Curtiss Aircraft to purchase 25 new PW-8 fighters, patterned after the R-6 Racer, if Curtiss would help modify one of the prototypes for use in the project. The D-12 engine on the PW-8 produced 435 horsepower and Mitchell's intended modifications were to enable it to make the flight at full throttle power setting. If the armament and unnecessary equipment were also removed from the XPW-8, additional fuel capacity could be installed to extend its range, and larger oil tanks for engine cooling. The flight plan calculated four stops of 30 minutes each for refueling. McCook Field; Saint Joseph, Missouri; Cheyenne, Wyoming; and remote Salduro Siding, Utah, were selected as refueling points, following a recently established mail route.

Lt. Maughan was chosen to make the flight because he was an experienced test pilot and a combat veteran accustomed to dealing with in-flight emergencies, and because he had already established speed records in 1922 and 1923.

The first two attempts to set the record.
The first attempt to establish the record was flown on July 10, 1923. Lt. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field, Long Island, at 4:56 a.m. The Allegheny Mountains were obscured by a thick undercast, and unable to navigate by landmarks, Lt. Maughan flew by dead reckoning, arriving at McCook Field 90 minutes behind schedule, where a broken tail fin rib caused an additional delay. The engine of the PW-8 quit in flight over Illinois because of a clogged fuel line, and Lt. Maughan made a forced landing in a farm field, damaging the landing gear and ending the attempt. 

The second attempt to set the record was made on July 19. After a 5:08 a.m. takeoff, Lt. Maughan completed the 570-mile first leg to McCook Field at 8:35 a.m, taking off again at 8:53 a.m. After reaching Saint Joseph, where he spent 39 minutes on the ground, Lt. Maughan experienced severe nausea from oil fumes on the next leg. He reached Cheyenne, however, where a broken oil line was found and soldered together. Approximately 90 minutes after leaving Cheyenne the oil line ruptured again and the nausea forced him to land at the air mail field at Rock Springs, Wyoming. 

The first two attempts had indicated that maximum performance was stressing the engine of the PW-8, necessitating that additional time be factored into the flight plan. With available daylight already reduced by a half hour by the date of the second attempt, no further tries were made in 1923.

Setting the record.
The next attempt was made using a different plane, serial number 24-204, the fourth PW-8 production aircraft. Curtiss modified it at its Long Island plant, removing its guns and mounts and increasing the 77-gallon fuel capacity by an additional 100 gallons.

Lt. Maughan took off from Mitchel Field at 3:58 a.m. Eastern Standard Time, June 23, 1924. He flew through intermittent rain and fog but still averaged 135 mph and reached McCook Field at Dayton at 8:10 a.m. EST. Although mechanics serviced the plane around in twenty minutes, one of the field's mechanics over-torqued the filler cap, securing it to the fuel intake housing and broke off the valve. The housing had to be removed, soldered, and replaced, costing an hour's delay.  

Lt. Maughan encountered thunderstorms between Dayton and St. Joseph, but reached Saint Joseph without incident. The grass field there was soft from heavy rain, limiting the takeoff weight of his plane. Unable to take on a full load of fuel, Lt. Maughan flew to North Platte, Nebraska, where he completely filled the fuel tank, but which caused a further 20-minute delay. 

The detour to North Platte also resulted in Lt. Maughan encountering a strong headwind, slowing his average groundspeed. He landed at the air mail field at Salduro Siding, a railroad stop adjacent to the Bonneville Salt Flats, at almost 6:30 p.m. local time and calculated that reaching San Francisco by dusk was still possible.

The last leg of the flight, over Nevada and the Sierra Nevada Mountains, was characterized by cloud strata, making navigation difficult in low light conditions. Lt. Maughan, from Logan, Utah, was familiar with the terrain however and recognized sufficient landmarks to approach San Francisco Bay from the north. He used a revolving light on Alcatraz Island to guide him to Crissy Field, the military airfield at the Presidio of San Francisco, where he landed in front of an estimated 50,000 spectators at 9:46 p.m. Pacific Standard Time, reportedly a minute before dusk.

Maughan's total flight time was 20 hours and 48 minutes. In addition to the publicity value of being the first transcontinental crossing within the hours of daylight, the flight established new records for time, distance, and average speed (128.37 mph) in trancontinental flights.

Roentgenium (IPA: , formerly Unununium) is a chemical element in the periodic table that has the symbol Rg and atomic number 111 making it one of the super-heavy atoms. It is a synthetic element whose longest-lived isotope has a mass of 280 and a half-life of 3.6 seconds. Due to its presence in Group 11 it is a transition metal and so probably would appear as a heavy, solid, shiny metal. Due to the inert pair effect, it should be colored like gold. 

 History .
It was discovery by  Peter Armbruster, Gottfried Münzenber and their team working at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany on December 8, 1994. Only three atoms of it were observed (all 272Rg), by the fusion of bismuth-209 and nickel-64 in a linear accelerator. (Nickel was bombarded onto the bismuth target.)

The name roentgenium was accepted as a permanent name on November 1 2004 in honor of Wilhelm Röntgen; before this date, the element was known under the temporary IUPAC systematic element name unununium (IPA: , symbol Uuu). Some research has referred to it as eka-gold.

The official baptism took place at GSI, on Friday November 17 2006, in presence of Annette Schavan, the Federal German Minister of Research.

Isotopes.
Three isotopes of roentgenium are known.  The longest-lived of these is 280Rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half-life of 3.6 s.  The shortest-lived isotope is 272Rg which decays through alpha decay and has a half life of 1.5 ms. The other known isotope, 279Rg, decays through alpha decay and has a half-life of 170 ms.

Trivia.
The elements in Group 11 used to informally be called the coinage metals, due to their historical use in coins. It is unlikely that roentgenium can be used to make coins since all of its isotopes are radioactive with very short half-lives, and nothing has been invented to hold atoms together.

<doc id="6103494" title="Slave craton" nonfiltered="72" processed="72" dbindex="1480072">
The Slave craton is a relatively small Archean craton (about 300,000 km²) located in the Northwest Territories of Canada. It is dominated by ca. 2.73-2.63 Ga greenstones and turbidite sequences and ca. 2.72-2.58 Ga plutonic rock, with large parts of the craton underlain by older gneiss and granitoid units. The Slave craton is a major component of the Canadian Shield and one of the most distinct and oldest building blocks of the North American cratonic lithosphere. The cratonic block extends from the Great Slave Lake at about 61 °N to Coronation Gulf on the Arctic Ocean at 69 °N. It covers longitudinally the area between about 105 °W to 117 °W. The Slave includes the Acasta Gneiss which is one of the oldest dated rock units on Earth at 4.03 Ga. 

The crust of the Slave craton is thought have amalgamated during a 2.69 Ga collision between a proto-Slave western basement complex, known as the Central Slave Basement Complex, and an eastern putative island arc terrane (Hackett River) along a N-S suture. Along the Acasta River, this basement complex yields protolith ages up to ca. 4.03 Ga, but apart from a central core with sporadic ages >3.5 Ga (Acasta to Point Lake), the Central Slave Basement Complex is mostly younger. Primary evidence for this lies in the N-S Pb and Nd isotope boundaries, and the apparent lack of old basement in the eastern Slave craton. From the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton, the following ages have been recorded: Cambrian, Siluro-Ordovician, Permian, Jurassic, Cretacous, and Eocene. (Bleeker et al., 2004)

Origins of the proto-craton and continent formations.
Zircon crystals from the Acasta Gneiss have been radiometrically dated at 4.4 billion years. Rocks this old are thought to have been formed by mantle mafic-ultramafic and crustal acid magmatism. Parts of the Central Slave Basement Complex reveal quartzite gneiss that is similar to the quartzite found in the Southern Cross Province of the Yilgarn craton. A potential supercontinent predating 2.8 Ga is cautiously hypothesized. However, the variable age uncertainties of these Archean quartzite gneisses most probably reflect an overall distribution of a global 3.0-2.8 Ga quartzite peak, rather than a direct correlation between the two cratons. This peak likely reflects progressive growth and stabilization of continental crust toward the end of the Archaean. (Bleeker, 2000).

The Slave craton's amalgamation with the Rae craton (ca. 2.0 Ga) initiated the growth of Laurentia (2.0-1.8 Ga). Within a broader context, it originated from the breakup of the much larger late Archean parental supercraton Sclavia, and is a remnant of the supercontinent Nuna. As a mere fragment of ancient crust, surrounded by Paleoproterozoic rifted margins, it is also a remnant from the break-up of a much larger late Archean landmass of the supercontinent Kenorland. The late Archean and earliest Proterozoic development of Slave crust should thus be viewed in the context of this larger supercraton (Sclavia), even though the shape and size of this earlier supercraton is unknown. The salient point is that cratons like the Slave only preserve parts of the much larger tectonic systems in which they were generated.

Post-dating the assembly of Laurentia and Nuna, the Slave craton, particularly along its margins, became partially buried beneath intra-continental Proterozoic basins. At ca. 1.269-1.267 Ga, the craton was partly uplifted and intruded by the giant Mackenzie dyke swarm, radiating from a plume center west of Victoria Island. This is the last major event affecting the core of the craton, although some younger mafic magmatic events affect its edges (e.g. the ca. 780 Ma Hottah sheets). Since that time, Slave crust has been "bobbing" gently up and down, with interior seas expanding and receding across the craton. Ordovician and Cretaceous sedimentary rocks and fossils are known as wall rock fragments in some of the central Slave kimberlites. (Bleeker, 2006).

Despite the relative stability at the surface, melting events were triggered in the subcontinental mantle lithosphere, leaving their traces as clusters of kimberlites across the craton. From the several hundreds of kimberlites now known across the craton, the following ages have been recorded: Cambrian, Siluro-Ordovician, Permian, Jurassic, Cretacous, and the Eocene. (Bleeker, 2006).

Early Archean Central Slave Basement Complex. 
The central and western parts of the craton are underlain by a large Mesoarchean to Hadean basement: the Central Slave Basement Complex (>100,000 km²). Along the Acasta River, this basement complex consists of polymetamorphic gneisses of tonalitic to gabbroic composition that yield protolith ages up to ca. 4.03 Ga. Apart from a central core with sporadic ages >3.5 Ga (Acasta to Point Lake), the Central Slave Basement Complex is mostly younger with important age modes, from detrital and protolith U-Pb zircon ages, around 3.40 Ga, 3.15 Ga, 2.95 Ga and 2.826 Ga. Data from the mantle suggest that at least part of the lithospheric mantle below the central part of the craton may be of similar antiquity. Pre-2.9 Ga supracrustal rocks have been found at the base of some greenstone belts but form only a small component. (Bleeker, 2004). Sometime after 2.85 Ga, the nucleus of the Meso- and Paleoarchean sialic crust of the Central Slave Basement Complex experienced regional uplift followed by gradual subsidence giving rise, first, to craton-scale unconformity, then to the thin transgressive veneer of crossbedded, highly mature, quartzitic sediments. This uplift-subsidence cycle is attributed to a mantle plume that gave rise to a subaerial komatiite flow, now preserved in the detrital chromite grains in the quartzite units. Following this uplift-subsidence cycle, rifting of the thermally weakened crust resulted in voluminous outpouring of pillow basalt flows and intrusion of associated dyke swarms. Much of the craton was submerged at this time so there is little sedimentary evidence left of this rifting. (Bleeker et al., 2000).

Neoarchean basement complex and Central Slave Cover Group.
By at least 2.9 Ga, the basement complex formed a thin but widespread, ca. 2.9-2.8 Ga cover sequence of siliciclastic and sedimentary rocks <200 m. thick. The basement-cover contact represents a sheared and metamorphosed unconformity. The overall topology of the greenstone belts in the western and central Slave province permits all quartzite and banded iron formations to be correlated into a single cover sequence. This lateral correlation is supported by the lithostratigraphic similarities that exist over distances of several hundred kilometers. The most distinctive lithologies are the detrital-chromite-bearing fuchsitic quartzite and thin banded iron formations that mark the onset of the Neoarchean cycle of supracrustal development.

The supermature and commonly fuchsitic quartzites mark the emergence and erosional unroofing of the basement complex in what was probably a CO2-rich atmosphere. Abundant detrital chromite suggest contemporaneous komatiitic volcanism. Similar fuchsitic quartzite sequences occur in many other cratons worldwide, particularly between ca. 3.1 Ga and 2.8 Ga. All the fuchsite in the quartzite units are considered to be the product of mica-producing metamorphic reactions during the shearing and considered to reflect detrital chromite input. In many localities fuchsitic orthoquartzite are intercalated with other clastic rocks such as polymict conglomerate and impure, mica-rich, flaggy quartzite. Pelitic schist occurs between the quartzite rocks and banded iron formation suggesting a progressive deepening of the depositional environment and trangressive migration of the shoreline. In most cases, the banded iron formations are capped with a thin sulfidic chert layer and then abruptly overlain with massive to pillowed basaltic flows. Highly magnesian mafic/ultramafic lavas have been observed at or near the base of the pillow basalt sequence (Bleeker et al., 2000). After 2.4 Ga, mature quartzites are rarely fuchsitic. The cover sequence itself is overlain by 2.73 to 2.63 Ga greenstone belts.

The Neoarchean supracrustal sequence is heavily intruded and cannibalized by plutonic suites ranging in age from 2.72-2.670 Ga synvolcanic plutons to 2.59-2.58 Ga late-orogenic batholithic granites. The supracrustal sequences, collectively known as the Yellowknife Supergroup, are represented by an early cover sequence comprising quartzite and banded iron formation (ca. 2.80 Ga), a thick dominantly tholeiitic greenstone sequence (ca. 2.70 Ga), younger arc-like sequences (ca. 2.69-2.61 Ga), extensive turbidite blankets (ca. 2.68-2.62 Ga), and finally syn-orogenic conglomerates deposited at ca. 2.60 Ga or shortly thereafter. The early cover sequence and the overlying tholeiites represent subaerial exposure and then volcanic-dominated rifting of the basement. Arc-like sequences formed in part on top of the attenuated basement and in progressively widening, juvenile, back-arc-like basins and contain some of Canada's largest undeveloped volcanogenic massive sulfide deposits. After 2.68 Ga, much of the Slave craton became overlain by the Burwash Basin, one of the largest and best-preserved Archean turbidite basins in the world, comparable in size and setting to the Japan Sea. During orogenesis, the supracrustal sequences were telescoped, thickened, and multiply folded between ca. 2.65 and 2.58 Ga, with a peak in crustal anatexis between 2.59-2.58 ga (the "granite bloom"). Numerous orogenic gold deposits formed throughout the Slave craton, either as shear- or vein-hosted deposits in deformed greenstones or within the chemical traps provided by banded iron formations in the turbidites. (Bleeker, 2004).

The Central Slave Cover Group hosts some of the more prominent banded iron formations (BIF) of the Slave craton, although most are thin (1-10 m) and variable in composition along strike, changing from oxide iron formation into silicate-rich varieties or merely ferruginous chert. Locally, however, folding has thickened the highly magnetic BIF into substantial thicknesses (e.g., at Amacher Lake, on the eastern flank of the Sleepy Dragon Complex), resulting in some of the highest amplitude total field magnetic anomalies in the Slave craton. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.73-2.66 Ga volcanism.
Wherever the thin cover sequence is recognized, it is overlain by a thick and extensive sequence of tholeiitic basalts, with minor komatiite and rhyolite tuff intercalations. In the Yellowknife greenstone belt, this basalt-dominated volcanic sequence is known as the Kam Group. Possible correlative basalt successions are known across the basement domain, as far east as the Courageous Lake belt, and at least as far north as around the Exmouth antiform in the Acasta area. This basalt sequence typically consists of several hundred meters to several kilometres of pillowed and massive flows, with thin felsic horizons, and intruded by numerous dykes and sills of several generations. (Bleeker, 2006).

Although these lavas extruded in a subaqueous environment, regional correlations suggest a basalt sequence approaching LIP proportions (areal distribution >100,000 km², typical thickness 1-6 km). Stratigraphy, dense dyke swarms, and isotopic data link this basalt sequence to the basement. Well-dated components of this widespread basalt-dominated sequence yield ages from 2.734 Ga to 2.697 Ga. The widespread basaltic volcanism probably accompanied rifting of the basement complex, possibly assisted by mantle plume activity. From a mantle perspective, it seems inconceivable that events associated with the voluminous basaltic volcanism recorded across the ancient basement terrain did not involve thinning or at least modification of the lithospheric mantle below the Central Slave Basement Complex. Large-scale melting was probably triggered by adiabatic rise of asthenospheric mantle. Perhaps, then, the ca. 2.7 Ga basaltic volcanism may have contributed to the highly depleted mantle compositions underlying the core of the craton. (Bleeker, 2006).

Post-2.70 Ga volcanism.
Following ca. 2.7 Ga basaltic volcanism and rifting, most areas in the Slave craton show a transition to calc-alkaline volcanism characterized by abundant felsic and intermediate volcanic rocks, calc-alkaline basaltic rocks, and intercalated volcaniclastic sedimentary rocks. In nearly all areas, these arc-like rocks are stratigraphically overlain by turbiditic sedimentary rocks. Ages for the arc-like volcanic rocks are typically in the range of 2.69-2.66 Ga.

The ca. 2.7 Ga rifting and basaltic volcanism initiated a complex sequence of events including craton-wide, 2.69-2.66 Ga, typically calc-alkalic volcanism and sub-volcanic intrusive activity. These largely juvenile arc-like rocks dominate the eastern part of the craton, while in the central and western part they stratigraphically overlie basement and its basaltic cover. Hence, the most likely setting appears an arc- or back arc-like environment that was constructed on highly extended continental crust. The craton-scale stratigraphic relationships and lack of a suture do not easily support models that invoke collision of an exotic, juvenile arc terrane. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.68-2.66 Ga sedimentation. 
Starting at ca. 2680 Ma, a broad turbidite basin-the Burwash Basin-developed across much of the craton and progressively buried the volcanic substrate. A persistence of volcanic intercalations up-section and late mafic sill complexes suggest a volcanically active extensional setting, perhaps best compared with modern back-arcs. The minimum size of this basin was ca. 400x800 km, comparable to that of the Japan Sea, and making it the largest and possibly best-preserved Archean turbidite basin in the world. Like the Japan Sea, the Burwash Basin was largely ensialic, in agreement with inferences by early workers. 

The Burwash Basin fill consists largely of immature greywackes and mudstones, deposited below wave base, and may locally be up to 10 km thick. Intercalated tuff layers have been dated at ca. 2.661 Ga. Across the Slave craton, the greywacke turbidites have been given different formational names: the classical Burwash Formation in the Yellowknife Domain; the Contwoyto Formation in central and northern Slave, identical in essentially all aspects to the Burwash Formation further south, except for the presence of intercalated iron formations; the Itchen Formation, a more mud-rich facies in the north-central Slave; and the Beechey Lake Group in the northeastern Slave. 

Many of the turbidite beds, particularly those of the Burwash and Contwoyto Formation, are sand dominated with only thin silt to mud sections at the top of the graded beds. In the Yellowknife Domain, thick amalgamated sand beds (2-10 m) are not unusual. Petrography, detrital zircons, and geochemical analysis indicate that the greywacke detritus consists of a mixture of mafic and felsic volcanic rocks and uplifted plutonic infrastructure, with only minor input from ancient basement rocks. The main axis of the basin and subsequent structural trends appear to have been northeast-southwest, distinctly across the north-south isotopic boundaries that track the nature of deep basement. This interpretation is based on the following observations: 

Identical Burwash Formation turbidites extend from the near Yellowknife area to the northeastern Slave. Banded iron formations in the turbidites are restricted to the northwest half of the craton, suggesting a northeast-southwest facies boundary or tectonic trend across the basin. Earliest folds in the turbidites, which formed between 2.65-2.63 Ga, have northeasterly trends after qualitative "unfolding" of younger fold generations. Early folds appear to form a systematic northeast-southwest trending fold belt. 
The earliest plutonic suite that intrudes folded Burwash strata, the ca. 2.63 Ga Defeat Suite, appears to form a northeast-southwest-trending magmatic belt across the southeastern half of the craton. With more and better U-Pb zircon ages, a tentative "volcanic line" of 2.661 Ga felsic volcanic complexes, coeval with turbidite sedimentation, has begun to emerge. This volcanic line also trends northeast-southwest and may represent the first recognition of a linear arc system. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.65-2.63 Ga closure of the Burwash Basin.
Subsequent tectonic events record the closure and folding of the Burwash Basin across the southern Slave craton with turbidite sedimentation sometime before 2.65 Ga. The latter age constraint is provided by early plutons of the Defeat Suite, a distinct and possibly subduction-related magmatic suite across the southern-southeastern Slave craton. Closure of the highly extended, but largely ensialic back-arc basin allowed considerable shortening and mobility but with a structural style dominated, at least at high structural levels, by fairly systematic, mostly upright, northeast-southwest trending fold trains. At deeper levels, e.g. along the basement-cover interface, the fold trains must have been detached allowing differential shortening of the basement and cover.

The folded Burwash strata do not represent an outboard accretionary prism (which would require a trench setting rather than the more likely back-arc setting), and there is no evidence for a discrete "Contwoyto terrane." The northeast-southwest structural grain of the fold belt is also recognized in the lithospheric mantle. Shallow subduction  may have emplaced distinct mantle slabs. These processes terminated with docking of an outboard terrane, either in the southeast or the northwest; but this terrane is not preserved, however, within the exposed Slave craton. Crustal thickening led to uplift and erosional exhumation of folded Burwash strata and the unroofing of Defeat Suite plutons. Detrital zircons of Defeat Suite age are recorded in younger sedimentary packages. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.63 Ga turbidites.
2.63 Ga turbidites exist along the northwestern margin of the craton and record a migration of tectonic activity to the northwest. Deposition was coeval with uplift and erosional unroofing of Defeat plutons and the tightly folded Burwash Formation strata. Shortly following their deposition, these younger turbidites were shortened and intruded by ca. 2.616-2.609 Ga tonalite-granodiorite plutons of the Concession suite. (Bleeker, 2004). 

In the multiply folded, metamorphosed, and intermittently exposed terrain of the western Slave craton, it has proven difficult to distinguish these younger turbiditic greywackes from Burwash Basin turbidites. There is no sharply defined demarcation line that separates the two turbidite packages and recognition of the younger sequence relies largely on the absence of Defeat Suite-age plutons and the presence of <2.64 Ga detrital zircons. Preliminary work suggests that the younger turbidite sequence contains abundant intercalated iron formations, mostly of silicate facies, those of the Damoti Lake area representing one of the more significant examples. Many of the iron formations are "lean", comprising background turbiditic greywacke variably enriched in metamorphic garnet, other Fe-rich silicates, and/or disseminated sulphides. 

A distinct, post-Burwash Basin, greywacke and/or volcaniclastic sediment package, associated with felsic volcanic rocks and subvolcanic intrusions, and dated at approximately 2.716-2.712 Ga, occurs along the tightly folded synclinal core of the High Lake greenstone belt of the northern Slave craton. This package is of significance in that it is one of the few examples of a preserved volcano-sedimentary carapace to one of the major plutonic suites, i.e. the coeval Concession Suite. (Bleeker, 2006).

Ca. 2.60-2.59 Ga final orogeny.
Starting at ca. 2.6 Ga, the entire craton was affected by cross-folding and significant further shortening, characterized by broadly north-south structural trends, and probably in response to final collision along a distant active margin of Sclavia. Moderate overthickening of the crust led to HT-LP metamorphism, widespread anatexis, the appearance of S-type granites, and a hot and weak lower crust, culminating in ca. 2.59-2.58 Ga extension and the regional  granite bloom . The intrusion of carbonatites and involvement of other mantle-derived melts indicate a role for mantle processes (possible delamination). While peak temperatures were attained in the lower crust, large basement-cored domes were amplified by buoyancy driven deformation; lower crustal devolatilization reactions mobilized gold-bearing fluids; and syn-orogenic clastic basins formed and were immediately infolded into tight synclines. At least one of these syn-orogenic clastic basins formed as late as ca. 2.58 Ga. Late strike-slip faulting overprinted and truncated the synclinally infolded clastic basins. This event in the craton's evolution transferred, irreversibly, a significant fraction of heat-producing elements and lower crustal fluids to the upper crust, thus allowing cooling and stiffening of the lower crust and setting the stage for cratonization and long-term preservation. When the lower crust cooled and coupled with the mantle, the Slave (within Sclavia) finally became a craton. (Bleeker, 2004).

Northern Slave province, Acasta Gneiss and Point Lake greenstone belt.
The Acasta Gneiss is a rock outcrop of Archaean tonalite gneiss located in the western section of the northern Slave province, just west of the Emile River. The rock exposed in the outcrop formed at 4.03 Ga and is the earliest known rock to have survived intact from the Earth's early crust. Plutonic activity occurred in the underlying basement of the Acasta area at ca. 3.4 Ga. and the overlying quartzite and banded iron formation of the Acasta Gneiss Complex ar dated at 2.8 Ga. This cover sequence is conformably overlain by pillow basalt flows, and in turn by metaturbidite units. This conformably overlying strata is part of the Archaen Yellowknife Supergroup. However, as part of the Central Slave Cover Group, the Acasta gneisses are unconformably overlain by the fuchsitic quartzite, firmly placing the Earth's oldest rocks within the old cratonic nucleus of the Slave Province prior to deposition of the ca. 2.8 Ga quartzite units. The ca. 4.0 Ga rocks of the Acasta River area forms an ancient enclave in a polycyclic heterogeneous gneiss terrane that trends around the Emile River sycline east to the Point Lake gneiss domain. 

To the east of the Acasta Gneiss lies the Point Lake greenstone belt. Quartzite and a banded iron formation sequence is found beneath the belt and below a small outlying greenstone belt to the west of Point Lake near the Greenville Lake basement complex. Gneissic rocks in the Point Lake area are separated from the gneisses in the Acasta area to the west by the Emile River supracrustal belt. The Emile River belt comprises two marginal greenstone belts of deformed pillowed basalt sequences. 
(Bleeker et al., 2000).

Eastern Slave province, Back River Volcanic Complex.
The following study is by Breeman et al. (2001): The Black River Volcanic Complex is an Archaean (2.708 to ca. 2.66 Ga) stratovolcano that lies 480 km. northeast of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories. It constitutes the Back Group of the Yellowknife Supergroup and is somewhat anomalous in the Slave craton because it has undergone only a low degree of deformation and is subhorizontal. The southern half of the complex is exposed at the crest of a small dome. This is the eroded portion of the stratovolcano that has been preserved in an upright position. The complex comprises four volcanic sedimentary sequences (Innerring, Thlewyco, Boucher-Regan, Kelsh) that correspond to the phases of growth and destruction of this stratovolcano. 

The Innerring sequence, which constitutes the oldest rocks of the complex, represents the upper part of an eroded early phase of the volcano (U-Pb zircon igneous age of 2.708 Ga). The Thlewyco sequence represents the main construction phase of the volcano and forms an outward dipping, annular succession around the Innerring sequence, with an aggregate thickness of 2500-5000 meters. Its stratigraphy changes dramatically around the crator, varying from five cycles of andesitic and rhylotic lava, followed by succession of volcanistic debris on the north side; to 30 subarial andesitic flowqs and rare pyroclastic and epivolcaniclastic units on the eastern side; to interlayered dacitic and andesitic lava and tuff overlain by a thick succession of voluminous, nonwelded, ash-flow tuff and volcaniclastic rocks on the south side. Volcanism in this sequence ended with the eruption of large rhyolite and dacite dome-flow complexes (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.692 Ga). The Innerring and Thlewycho sequences represent a complex history of explosive erruptions from numerous eruptive centers.

The Boucher-Regan sequence, with its predominance of pillowed lava flows, suggests that this northern-flank of the volcano was submerged during deposition. The Kelsh sequence on the northwestern side comprises epiclastic volcarenite, rhyolite-dacite block breccia from lava domes, polymict breccia, and a conglomerate of andesite, dacite-rhyolite clasts, and andesitic tuff. The exposed succession consists of iron-formation, oolitic-stromatolitic carbonate, sulphidic volcaniclastic rocks and graphitic slate that marks the end of volcanism. The Kelsh sequence forms a broad apron that is interpreted as a shallow, sunmarine to subaerial, clastic fan derived by degradation of the volcanic pile (U-Pb zircon dated at 2.586 Ga). (Breeman et al., 2001). 

Age determinations in the Black River complex are similar to the ages of volcanic rock found in the upper Kam Group of the Yellowknife greenstone belt as well as other volcanic centers in the western Slave province. Detrital zircon geochronology on turbiditic sequences confirm a secondary deposition of turbidite units at ca. 2.62-2.60 Ga that was widespread throughout the Slave province. (Breeman et al., 2001).

Southern Slave province, Yellowknife greenstone belt.
The Yellowknife greenstone belts consists of crossbedded orthoquartzite, together with >3.0 Ga gneissic xenoliths that cut through the belt. U/Pb geochronologic data of the greenstone belt and the adjacent granitoid rocks confirm that some of the granitoid rocks below the greenstone belt represent old basement. Plutonic activity occurred in the underlying basement at ca. 2.95 Ga. Detrital zircons in the quartzite north of Yellowknife have been dated at >3.9 Ga. (Bleeker et al., 2000). Seafloor hydrothermal deposits and alteration and minor sulphide mineralization occurs in the Yellowknife belt (e.g., the Homer Lake showing, and horizons northeast of Bell Lake). Neoarchean bimodal rift volcanic rocks overlie faulted basement in the basal greenstones of the Yellowknife belt.

The late Archean stratigraphy in Yellowknife is compatible with the rifting interpretation outlined above in the "Post-2.70 Ga volcanism" section of this article. In Yellowknife, the top of the sequence is represented by voluminous basaltic flows and intercalated felsic volcanic rocks of the Yellowknife Bay Formation, dated at ca. 2.7 Ga. In support of the overall regional correlation, similar ca. 2.7 Ga ages have been obtained from Courageous Lake and Acasta areas. Stratigraphy, dense dyke swarms, and isotopic data link the basalt sequence to the basement. At the top of the Kam Group, bimodal volcanic rocks of the Yellowknife Bay Formation become progressively more intercalated with volcaniclastic sediments, before final intrusion by thick tholeiitic sills. One of these sills, the Kam Point gabbro sill, has a preliminary baddeleyite age of ca. 2.697 Ga. (Bleeker, 2006).

For the Burwash Formation of the Yellowknife Domain refer to the above "Ca. 2.68-2.66 Sedimentation" section of this article.

Economic geology.
Proterozoic rift-related magmatic suites and arcs around the margins of the craton host a variety of mineral deposits, and several hundred Phanerozoic kimberlites support Canada's first diamond mines. Geologic interest has been renewed in the craton by the discoveries of kimberlite diamond occurrences in the region. The Eocene (ca. 55-50 Ma) kimberlite pipes of the Lac de Gras area in the central Slave craton now support two highly profitable diamond mines, Ekati and Diavik. Several other diamond mines are in various stages of development. In just over a decade, diamonds have become the most profitable commodity within this ancient craton.

The banded iron formations (BIFs) of the Slave craton appear to be of low economic value, although some may possibly host epigenetic gold mineralization and may be underexplored. However, most iron formation-hosted gold mineralization appears to be associated with BIFs hosted in low to medium-grade turbidite packages. However, the Burwash Formation metaturbidites and the Yellowknife greenstone belt do have epigenetic gold mineralization. Epigenetic gold mineralization throughout the Slave craton were caused by deformation and associated metamorphism. In the Yellowknife greenstone belt, it led to formation of the ca. 15 million ounce Con-Giant Au deposit, along a complex system of mostly reverse shear zones. As is typical for this class of deposits, the Con-Giant system occurs mostly within moderate to strongly deformed basaltic rocks, in proximity to a regional stratigraphic break, the Yellowknife River Fault Zone. An asymmetric synclinal panel of syn-orogenic conglomerates (the Jackson Lake Formation) occurs along this fault zone. Identical relationships are observed in several other major Archean gold camps, most notably Timmins, Kirkland Lake, and Kalgoorlie. The critical control common to all these camps is localization of Au mineralization within significant bends of the regional fault zones; these bends were most likely dilational during emplacement of the gold-bearing quartz veins. 

Although numerous other volcanic-hosted gold vein systems are known from the Slave craton, some of which were briefly in production in the past, only one other major camp has emerged in recent years. This camp occurs in the Hope Bay belt, on the Coronation Gulf coast of the Slave craton, and consists of a string of deposits (Boston, Doris, Madrid) that are being readied for production. Elsewhere, despite significant past exploration, overall potential for this class of deposits remains excellent. Several greenstone belts throughout the Slave craton have very similar structural-stratigraphic characteristics to that of the Yellowknife belt, including a thick, folded turbidite pile adjacent to a basaltic greenstone belt, a regional deformation zone, and a young conglomerate package. Best examples are the Point Lake and Arcadia Bay areas. (Bleeker, 2006).

Another class of mineral deposits related to final orogenesis is that of rare-element enriched granitoids, particularly highly evolved anatectic granites and their pegmatites. Tin (cassiterite) and Li (spodumene) were briefly mined from such pegmatites in the Yellowknife Domain, but other pegmatite fields are known throughout the Slave craton. From a global metallogeny point of view, these occurrences are of interest as they typically correlate with ancient, multiply recycled, felsic crust. (Bleeker, 2006).

Fuchsitic quartzites below the iron formations are enriched in detrital minerals, including highly stable heavy minerals such as chromite, zircon, and rutile. Individual, dark, detrital chromite grains are a characteristic feature of these otherwise white to grey quartzites. Commonly, these chromite grains have undergone variable reaction towards bright green fuchsitic mica during metamorphism and deformation. In a few localities, chromites are concentrated in seams of "black sand", but clearly such concentrations are too small to be of economic interest. If road access were available, some of the green-white quartzite would make attractive building or decorative stone. In Greenland, India, and Australia, similar quartzites are often quarried for this purpose. Elsewhere in the world, quartzites similar to these contain paleoplacer deposits of gold and/or uranium. (Bleeker, 2006).

The North American A-36A Apache/Invader was the ground-attack/dive-bomber version of the North American P-51 Mustang, from which it could be distinguished by the presence of rectangular, slatted dive brakes above and below the wings. A total of 500 A-36A dive bombers served in North Africa, the Mediterranean, Italy and the China-Burma-India theater during World War II before being withdrawn from operational use in 1944.

Design and development.
With the introduction of the North American Mustang I with the RAF Army Co-operation Squadrons in February 1942, the new fighter began combat missions as a low-altitude reconnaissance and ground-support aircraft. Supplementing the Curtiss P-40 Tomahawks already in service, Mustang Is were first supplied to No. 26 Squadron RAF, then rapidly deployed to ten additional squadrons by June 1942. Drawing first blood over Dieppe on 19 August 1942, a No. 414 (RCAF) Squadron Mustang downed the formidable Focke-Wulf Fw 190, the first victory for a Mustang.  Despite the limiting high-altitude performance of the Allison V-1710 engine, the RAF was enthusiastic about its new mount which "performed magnificently ."

During the Mustang I's successful combat initiation, North American's president Howard "Dutch" Kindelberger pressed the newly redesignated USAAF US Army Air Force for a fighter contract for the essentially similar P-51, 47 of which had passed into the USAAF when the Lend-Lease contract with Britain ran out of funds. The P-51 utilized four 20 mm wing cannons replacing the original four .30 caliber and two .50 caliber Browning machine guns mounted in the wings and two .50 caliber "chin" machine guns. No funds were available for new fighter contracts in Fiscal Year 1942 but General Oliver Echols wanted to ensure the P-51 remained in production. 

Since appropriations were available for an attack aircraft, Echols specified modifications to the P-51 to turn it into a dive bomber. The contract for 500 A-36A aircraft fitted with bomb racks and dive brakes was in place (16 April 1942)  even before the first flight of the P-51 in May 1942.  With orders on the books, North American Aviation (NAA) began modifying the P-51 to accept the bomb shackles that were already tested in a "long-range ferry" program that the RAF had stipulated . Engineering studies totalling 40,000 hours and wind tunnel testing with a 1/8 scale model was completed in June 1942. Utilizing the basic P-51 airframe and Allison engine, structural reinforcing  "beefed up" several high stress areas and "a set of hydraulically operated dive brakes were installed in each main wing plane."  Due to the slightly inboard placement of the bomb racks and unique installation of four cast aluminum dive brakes, a complete redesign of the P-51 wing was required. 

The USAAF also had 310 P-51As on order that  were differentiated by having provision for drop tanks, an armament of only four, wing-mounted 0.50 in Browning machine guns and an Allison V-1710-81 1200 hp (91248 kgM). Like the A-36A, the P-51A was fitted with bomb racks but was not intended for use primarily as a fighter-bomber. 

The first A-36A (42-83663) was rolled out of the NAA Inglewood plant in September 1942, rapidly going through flight testing with the first flight in October and deliveries commencing soon after of the first production machines. The A-36A continued the use of nose-mounted .50 caliber machine guns along with wing armament of four .50 caliber machine guns. Another major alteration was the use of a sea level-rated Allison V-1710-87 that delivered 1325 hp at 3000 ft but had greatly reduced output above 12,000 ft. 

Operational service. 

The A-36A-1NA ("Apache," the A-36A's official name was rarely used) joined the 27th Fighter Bomber Group composed of four squadrons based at Rasel Ma in French Morocco in April 1943 during North Africa . The 27th had a mixed component of Douglas A-20 Havocs and A-36As while the second operational unit, the 86th Fighter Bomber Group (Dive) arrived in March 1943 with the first pilots trained and qualified on the A-36A.  On 6 June 1943, both of these A-36A units flew combat missions directed against the island of Pantelleria. The island fell to Allied attack and became the home base for the two A-36A groups during the invasion of Sicily. The A-36A proved to be a potent weapon; it could be put into a vertical dive at 12,000 ft, deploying its dive brakes, limiting the dive speed to 390 mph. Pilots soon recognized that extending the dive brakes after "peel-off" led to some unequal extension of the brakes due to varying hydraulic pressure, setting up an invariable slight roll which impeded aiming. Proper technique soon cured this anomaly and, subsequently, pilots achieved extremely consistent results.  Depending on the target and defences, the bomb release took place between 2,000 ft and 4,000 ft, followed by an immediate sharp "pull up." 

Dive brakes in the wings gave the A-36A greater stability in a dive, but a myth had arisen that they were useless due to malfunctions or because of the danger of deploying them and that they should be wired closed.  Capt. Charles E. Dills, 27th Fighter Bomber Group, 522nd Squadron, XIIth Air Force emphatically stated in a postwar interview: "I flew the A-36 for 39 of my 94 missions, from 11/43 to 3/44. They were never wired shut in Italy in combat. This "wired shut" story apparently came from the training group at Harding Field, Baton Rouge, LA." 

However, tactical reconnaissance training with P-51 and A-36 aircraft had delivered some disquieting accident rates. At one time, A-36 training had resulted in the type having "the highest accident rate per hour's flying time" of any USAAF aircraft. The most serious incident involved an A-36A shedding both wings when its pilot tried to pull out from a 450 mph dive.  Combat units flying the A-36A were ordered to restrict their approach to a 70° "glide" attack and refrain from using dive brakes.  This order was generally ignored by experienced pilots but some units did wire dive brakes shut until modifications were made to the hydaulic actuators. Nevertheless, the A-36 was used with great success as a dive-bomber, acquiring a reputation for precision, sturdiness and silence.

By late May 1943, 300 A-36As had been deployed to the Mediterranean Theater, with many of the first batch sent to the 27th to re-build the group following losses as well as completing the final transition to an all-A-36A unit. Both groups were actively involved in air support during the Sicilian campaign, becoming especially adept at "mopping" up enemy gun positions and other strong points as the Allies advanced. During this operation, the 27th Group circulated a petition to adopt the name "Invader" for their rugged little bomber, receiving unofficial recognition of the more fitting name.  Despite the name change, most combat reports preferred the name "Mustang" for all of the variants.  The Germans gave it a flattering if fearsome accolade, calling the A-36As, "screaming helldivers." 

Besides dive bombing, the A-36A racked up aerial victores totalling 84 enemy aircraft and an "ace," Lieutenant Michael T. Russo from the 27th Fighter Bomber Group (ultimately, the only ace using the Allison-engined Mustang).   As fighting intensified in all theaters where the A-36A operated, the dive bomber began to suffer an alarming loss rate with 177 falling to enemy action.  The main reason for the attrition was the hazardous missions that placed the A-36A "on the deck" facing murderous ground fire. German defences in southern Italy included placing cables across hill tops to snare the attacking A-36As.  Despite establishing a "reputation for reliability and performance," the one "Achilles' heel" of the A-36A (and the Mustang) remained its vulnerable cooling system leading to many of the losses.  By June 1944, A-36As in Europe were replaced by Curtiss P-40s and Republic P-47 Thunderbolts . 

A-36As had also served with the 311th Fighter Bomber Group in the China-Burma-India theater. The 311th had arrived in Dinjan, India by late summer 1943 after being shipped across the Pacific via Australia.  Two squadrons were equipped with the A-36A while the third flew P-51As. Tasked with reconaissance, dive bombing, attack and fighter missions, the A-36A was outclassed by its main oppossion, the Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa, codenamed "Oscar." The light and highly agile Japanese fighter could outfly the A-36A at all altitudes but did have some weak points- it was lightly armed and offered little protection for pilot or fuel tanks. However, the A-36A fought at a significant disadvantage, having to carry out long-range missions often at altitudes above the "Hump" that meant its Allison engine was below peak performance. In a fighter escort mission over Burma, three A-36As were lost without scoring a single victory. The A-36A CBI missions continued throughout 1943-1944 with indifferent results. The A-36A remained in service in small numbers throughout the remaining year of the war, some being retained in the US as training aircraft. 
Legacy.
"The type's relatively brief service life should not camouflage the fact that it made a major contribution to the Allied war effort"  especially in the Mediterranean and it amounted to the first USAAF combat use of a Mustang variant.

Survivors.
Relatively few A-36As survived the war and the subsequent postwar retirement and scrapping of obsolete types. One A-36A, bearing race number #44, owned and flown by Kendall Everson, was entered in the 1947 Kendall Trophy Race. The old warhorse was able to reach 377.926 mph, finishing second to the winning P-51D flown by Steve Beville.  

A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83665/N39502) is on display as "Margie H" at the National Museum of the USAF in Dayton, Ohio. There are at least three A-36s undergoing restoration. The Warhawk Air Museum in Caldwell, Indiana has A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83738/N4607V) under restoration for future display. A-36As currently under restoration to flying condition include the A-36A (USAAF Serial #42-83731/N251A) owned by Tom Friedkin in Chino, California (presently being refurbished at the Planes of Fame Museum after her return from the Flying Legends 2002 Air Display at Duxford) and the Collings Foundation A-36A being restored in New Smyrna Beach, Florida.

<doc id="2528904" title="Mike Mordecai" nonfiltered="77" processed="76" dbindex="1480077">
Michael Howard Mordecai (born December 13, 1967 in Birmingham, Alabama) is a right-handed hitting infielder in Major League Baseball who most recently played for the Florida Marlins.

School and minor leagues.
Mordecai graduated from Hewitt Trussville High School, Trussville, Alabama in 1986 where he played baseball, basketball and football.  For the next three years he attended University of South Alabama and was inducted into the school's Hall of Fame on April 27, 2001.  During his time at South Alabama, he was a two-time All-American and named to the All-Sun Belt Conference team each year.  In 1987, he helped the Jaguars to the conference title.  Mordecai majored in criminal justice and minored in sociology. 

With their sixth round selection of the 1989 MLB Draft, the Atlanta Braves drafted Mordecai. He began his minor league career at Class A Burlington and eventually worked his way up to Greenville. In 1992, he made his way to AAA Richmond on June 19. In 1993, he was selected as Richmond's Most Competitive Player. He played every defensive position with the exception of center field and pitcher that season.

Atlanta and a championship.
In 1994, Mordecai made it to the majors but only for four at bats. His first tour was from May 3-20, when he replaced Jeff Blauser on the roster. Mordecai's first hit was a game-winning three-run home run in the ninth inning against the Philadelphia Phillies. He received the John M. Zwack III Memorial Award for being the most community-minded player.

Mordecai was a key cog in the 1995 World Series team as he provided depth on the bench. He made his first start at second on July 16 at San Diego. In the NLDS he went 2-for-3 with a double and 2 RBI. His pinch-hit single in the ninth inning of Game 2 gave the Braves the go-ahead run. In the World Series, he went 1-for-3.

Unfortunately for Mordecai, the Braves had Mark Lemke at second base, Chipper Jones at third and Fred McGriff at first preventing him from getting more than a reserve role with the team.  Mordecai was the Braves' starting third baseman on opening day though as Chipper Jones sat out with an injury.  On August 30, he collected the first three-hit game of his career at Chicago.

Montreal.
Mordecai's inability to stay consistent while a member of the Braves frustrated the front office and, in 1998, he joined the Montreal Expos.  Mordecai made 53 starts the next year.  He then enjoyed his best seasons there in 2000 and 2001.  On April 2, 2001, Mordecai demonstrated his versatility by playing catcher in the tenth inning of a game against the Cubs after Montreal's first catcher, Michael Barrett, was ejected and their second catcher, Sandy Martínez, was injured.

Florida and another championship.
In the midst of the 2002 trade deadline, Mordecai was hitting poorly for Montreal and was traded to the Florida Marlins.  His statistics for the season drastically improved after the trade. The following season, he was again a key part in helping the inexperienced Marlins win the 2003 World Series.  In Game 6 of the NLCS, the Marlins were five outs away from being eliminated when Cubs fan, Steve Bartman, derailed his team by preventing a foul ball from being an out.  Mordecai's three-run double blew the game open highlighting the Cubs' subsequent historic collapse in what is sometimes referred to as simply "The Inning".  Despite his heroics, it was Mordecai's last appearance of the season as he didn't play in the World Series.

On June 1, 2004, Mordecai again filled the role as emergency catcher, this time for eight innings after Ramón Castro was injured.

Mordecai took a job as manager with the Marlins minor league affiliate Jamestown Jammers in December 2004.  A few days later, the team announced that they would give him a chance to join the team in September so he could reach ten years of Major League service.

Mordecai was married on February 5 2000 and his wife, Jennifer, gave birth to son Jackson on August 2 that year. He also has a daughter, Taylor Mae, who was born on April 27 1995.

<doc id="2585864" title="Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh" nonfiltered="78" processed="77" dbindex="1480078">
Harold Julian Amery, Baron Amery of Lustleigh, PC (27 March 1919   3 September 1996) was a prominent British politician of the Conservative Party, who served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for 39 of the 42 years between 1950 and 1992. He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1960.  He was created a life peer upon his retirement from the House of Commons in 1992. For three decades, he was a leading figure in the Conservative Monday Club.

Family and education.
Amery's father was Leo Amery, the prominent British statesman and Conservative politician.

One of Julian's brothers, John, was a dedicated anti-Communist, and was hanged for treason by the British government at the end of World War II for having gone to Germany, joined the Nazis, and organized the British Free Corps to fight alongside the Germans against the Soviet Union.

Julian Amery was educated at Eton College and Balliol College, Oxford. On 26 January 1950, he married Catherine Macmillan, a daughter of Harold Macmillan, though politically Amery was at odds with the elder Macmillan. Julian and Catherine had one son and three daughters.  Julian was widowed in 1991.

Military service.
Before World War II started, Amery was a war correspondent in the Spanish Civil War and later an attaché for the British Foreign Office in Belgrade. After the war began, he served in both the Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Army, eventually reaching the rank of Captain. He spent most of the war in the eastern Mediterranean (the Middle East, Malta, Yugoslavia), and served as Liaison Officer to the Albanian Resistance Movement in 1944. The following year, he went to China to work with General Carton de Wiart, then Prime Minister's Personal Representative to Generalissimo Chiang Kai Shek.

Political career.
Amery won a Parliamentary seat in the first general election held after he returned to civilian life, in 1950. He was elected as the Conservative MP for Preston North, a seat he held until 1966. 

While sitting for Preston North, Amery held a number of government offices, all in governments led by his father-in-law, now the Prime Minister. He began with two Under-Secretaryships of State: for War (1957-1958) and for the Colonies (1958-1960). He was then promoted to Secretary of State for Air (1960-1962), followed by a promotion to the Cabinet post of Minister of Aviation (1962-1964).

Amery lost his seat in 1966, but was elected again in 1969 for Brighton Pavilion, a seat he would hold until 1992, when he retired and was created a life peer as Baron Amery of Lustleigh, of Preston in the County of Lancashire and of Brighton in the County of East Sussex.

Under the Heath ministry, Amery held three sub-Cabinet posts: Minister for Public Works (1970-1972), Minister for Housing and Construction (1970-1972), and Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (1972-1974).

Monday Club.
For 30 years Julian Amery was an active member and later a Patron of the Conservative Monday Club, where he became friendly with General Sir Walter Walker, subsequently writing the foreword for Walker's anti-Soviet book, The Next Domino. He had been Guest of Honour at the Club's Annual Dinner at the Cutlers' Hall, in 1963. In 1965, he wrote the foreword for Club activist Geoffrey Stewart-Smith's book, No Vision Here. On May Day 1970, he was one of the Club's principal speakers at their 'Law and Liberty' rally in Trafalgar Square, held in answer to the 'Stop the Seventy Tour' campaign, designed to stop the South African cricket tour.

Julian Amery was the Monday Club's Guest-of-Honour at their Annual Dinner held at the Savoy Hotel, London, in January 1974, and again at the dinner at the end of the Club's two-day Conference in Birmingham in March 1975.

Political views.
He was, for a time, in favour of entry to the European Common Market, and also of the nuclear deterrent, both causes of some discord between himself and his old friend Enoch Powell.  He was, however, regarded by most as an Imperialist, and his father Leo noted at the time of the Suez crisis that "only Julian and Enoch Powell felt sufficiently strongly about the issue to go to the point of risking the government's existence".

In 1963, Amery took charge of Quintin Hogg's (Lord Hailsham) campaign for leadership of the Conservative Party. 189; 324.

In early 1975, he took part in a House of Commons debate on the Trades Unions Congress's invitation to Alexander Shelepin, the former Soviet KGB Chief, to visit Britain. He stated that "more and more people are beginning to look upon the TUC as a Communist-penetrated show and this invitation must strengthen that view."

According to Margaret Thatcher (in her 1995 memoirs The Path to Power), when Harold Wilson's Labour government proposed devolution for Scotland in 1976, "Julian Amery and Maurice Macmillan proved effective leaders of the anti-devolution Tory camp."

Although he was Macmillan's son-in-law, he failed to defend him when Count Nikolai Tolstoy published The Minister and the Massacres in 1986, focusing the ultimate burden of blame sharply on Macmillan for the repatriation of anti-communists and old Russian émigrés to Stalin and certain death. Amery stated that the repatriations were "one of the few blots on Harold that I can think of".

Trivia.
 Before Amery married, he had dated novelist Barbara Pym.
 Amery became a close friend of King Zog I of Albania and described him as "the cleverest man I have ever met".

<doc id="2317493" title="Ernst Nolte" nonfiltered="79" processed="78" dbindex="1480079">
Ernst Nolte (born 11 January 1923) is a German historian. Born in Witten, Germany to a Roman Catholic family, Nolte was a student of Martin Heidegger. Nolte s major interest is the comparative studies of Fascism and Communism. His work has been the object of extreme controversy. 

Fascism In Its Epoch.
Nolte first rose to fame with his 1963 book Der Faschismus in seiner Epoche (Fascism In Its Epoch; translated into English as The Three Faces Of Fascism), in which Nolte argued that Fascism arose as a form of resistance and a reaction against modernity. Using the methods of phenomenology, Nolte subjected German Nazism, Italian Fascism and the French Action Française movements to a comparative analysis. Nolte s conclusion was that fascism was the great anti-movement; namely it was anti-liberal, anti-communist, anti-Semitic, anti-capitalist, and anti-bourgeois. In Nolte s view, fascism was the rejection of everything the modern world had to offer and was an essentially negative phenomenon. The Three Faces of Fascism was much praised at the time and since as a seminal contribution to the creation of a theory of generic fascism. Roger Griffin has written that although written in an excessively arcane and obscure language, Nolte's theory of fascism as a  form of resistance to transcendence  (transcendence in German can be translated as the "spirit of modernity") marked an important step in the understanding of fascism, and helped to spur scholars into new avenues of research on fascism.

Later in the 1970s, Nolte was to reject the theory of generic Fascism that he had championed in The Three Faces of Fascism and instead embraced totalitarian theory as a way of explaining both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. In Nolte's opinion, Nazi Germany was a "mirror image" of the Soviet Union and with the exception of the  technical detail  of mass gassing everything the Nazis did, the Communists in Russia did first.

The Historikerstreit.
Nolte is best known for his role in launching the Historikerstreit (Historian s Dispute) of 1986-1987. On June 6, 1986 Nolte published an article entitled Vergangenheit, die nicht vergehen will ("The Past That Will Not Go Away") in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung. His article was a distillation of ideas that Nolte had first introduced in lectures that he delivered in 1976 and in 1980. Nolte advanced the view that the crimes of the Nazis were only a defensive reaction against the crimes of the Soviets. In Nolte s view, National Socialism had only arisen in response to the  class genocide  and  Asian barbarism  of the Bolsheviks". Along the same lines, Nolte argued that the Holocaust, or "racial genocide" as Nolte prefers to call it, was an understandable if excessive response on the part of Adolf Hitler to the Soviet threat. Nolte labeled the Holocaust an "überschießende Reaktion" (overshooting reaction) to Bolshevik crimes. As proof of this argument, Nolte presented a letter written by Chaim Weizmann, the President of the World Zionist Organization on September 3, 1939 to the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain pledging full and unconditional support to the British war effort. Nolte has called Weizmann's letter to Chamberlain a "Jewish declaration of war  against Germany" (see also "Judea Declares War on Germany"). The second piece of evidence Nolte presented was a book written in 1940 by the American author Theodore N. Kaufman called Germany Must Perish! that appealed to have all German men sterilized. Nolte argued that the Nazis felt forced to stage the Holocaust because Hitler concluded that entire Jewish population of the world had declared war on Germany. From Nolte s point of view, the Holocaust was act of  Asian barbarism  forced on the Germans out of the fear over what Joseph Stalin, who Nolte charged had significant Jewish support, might do to them. Nolte has argued that after the Japanese attack on the United States in 1941, the U.S. authorities interned the entire Japanese-American population, so by the same logic, the Germans were within their rights to "intern" the Jewish population of Europe in concentration camps". . 

Subsequently, Nolte expanded upon these views in his 1987 book  Der europäische Bürgerkrieg, 1917-1945 (The European Civil War, 1917-1945) in which he claimed that the entire 20th century was an age of genocide, totalitarianism, and tyranny, and that the Holocaust had been merely one chapter in the age of violence, terror and population displacement. Nolte claimed that this age had started with the genocide of the Armenians during World War I, and also included the Stalinist terror in the Soviet Union, Maoist terror in China as manifested in such events as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution, compulsory population exchanges between Greece and Turkey in 1922-1923, and the Khmer Rouge genocide in Cambodia. In Nolte's view, the great deciding event of the 20th century had been the Russian Revolution of 1917, which in Nolte's view, plunged all of Europe into a long-simmering civil war that lasted until 1945. In Nolte's opinion, fascism, which was Communism's twin arouse as a desperate response by the threatened middle classes of Europe to what Nolte has often called the  Bolshevik peril .  

These views ignited a firestorm of controversy. Most historians in West Germany and virtually all historians outside Germany condemned Nolte s interpretation as factually incorrect, and as coming dangerously close to justifying the Holocaust. Some of the historians who denounced  Nolte s work included Hans Mommsen, Martin Broszat, Hans-Ulrich Wehler, Heinrich August Winkler, Wolfgang Mommsen, Karl-Dietrich Bracher and Eberhard Jäckel. Criticism from abroad came from Ian Kershaw, Gordon A. Craig, Richard J. Evans, Saul Friedländer, John Lukacs, Michael Marrus, and Timothy Mason. Wehler was so enraged by Nolte's views that he wrote a book Entsorgung der deutschen Vergangenheit: ein polemischer Essay zum "Historikerstreit in 1988, which as its title indicates comprised twenty polemicial essays attacking every aspect of Nolte's views. Coming to Nolte's defence were the journalist Joachim Fest, and the historians Klaus Hildebrand, Rainer Zitelmann and Hagen Schulze.

In particular, Nolte s  evidence  for a Jewish war on Germany has been dismissed. It has been argued that Weizmann s letter to Chamberlain was written in his capacity as head of the World Zionist Organization, not on behalf of the entire Jewish people in Europe, and at any rate must be seen in the light of Weizmann s appeasing stance towards the British government in general; and that Nolte s views are based on the spurious idea that all Jews are Zionists and so follow the lead of Zionist leaders. Furthermore, it has been contended that there is no evidence that Hitler ever heard of Weizmann s letter. As for Kaufman s book, the Nazis were certainly aware of it; during the war, Germany Must Perish! was translated into German and widely promoted as an example of what Jews thought about Germans. But most historians contended that the views of one American Jew can in no way be taken as typical of what all European Jews were thinking, and to put the call for the forced sterilization of Germans that was never carried out as Allied policy in the same league as the Holocaust shows a profound moral insensitivity. Moreover, it has been shown that there is no indication that the Kaufman's book ever played any role in the decision-making progress that led to the Holocaust.

Finally, it has been contended that Nolte's comparison of the Holocaust with the internment of the Japanese-Americans is false, because Jews were sent to death camps, not concentration camps and that the U.S. government did not attempt to exterminate the Japanese-Americans in the interment camps. 

Nolte s critics have frequently charged him with having neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic sympathies. Nolte has always vehemently denied these charges, and has insisted that he is a neo-liberal in his politics. Nolte is by his own admission, an intense German nationalist and his stated goal is to restore the sense of pride in their history that he feels the Germans have been missing since 1945. Nolte s defenders have pointed to numerous statements on his part condemning Nazi Germany and the Holocaust. Nolte s critics have acknowledged these statements, but go on to claim that Nolte makes arguments that can be construed as being sympathetic to the Nazis such as his defence of the Commissar Order as a legitimate military order or his use of Nazi-era language such as Nolte's practice of referring to the Red Army soldiers in World War II as  Asiatic hordes . In particular, controversy has centered around an argument that Nolte made in his 1985 essay  Between Myth and Revisionism  from the book Aspects of the Third Reich. In his essay Nolte argued that if the PLO were to destroy Israel, then the subsequent history written in the new Palestinian state would portray the former Israeli state in the blackest of colors". ; in Nolte s opinion, a similar situation exists in regards to the history of Nazi Germany. Many historians such as the British historian Richard J. Evans have claimed that by making this argument Nolte is attempting to claim that the only reason why Nazism is seen is evil is because Germany lost World War II, not because of the Holocaust. Nolte has always denied these allegations of Nazi sympathies. Likewise, Nolte has pointed out that he always refused frequent offers to speak at the gatherings of the Institute for Historical Review; Nolte's critics such as Deborah Lipstadt have charged that the nature of Nolte's arguments about the Holocaust has led to these frequent invitations to speak at the I.H.R. Lipstadt has argued that in her view the nature of Nolte's work is a more insidious and dangerous form of Holocaust denial then the work of David Irving. 

In June 2000, Nolte was awarded the Konrad Adenauer Prize for Literature. The award attracted widespread protests and controversy. Currently, Nolte is a professor at the Free University of Berlin.

Folkspraak (other variants are common - see Name) is an international auxiliary language (IAL) project based on the Germanic languages, currently in development. It is intended to be quickly learnable by all Germanic speakers (a group including over 465 million native speakers, and an additional 300 to 900 million who speak English as a second language). It is not meant to be designed by any one individual, but is a collective work created by all interested parties, according to the Folkspraak charter guidelines. 

 Discussion and dialects .

Currently no final version of Folkspraak exists, with several developers having their own versions displaying their own preferences, though some form of homogenisation is generally the eventual aim. Thus there are currently disagreements about many rather basic areas of the language including orthography, grammar, and vocabulary. Interestingly, many of the dialects proposed tend to look most like an English-influenced version of Dutch or Low German, although many have notably North Germanic features.

The guiding idea for building the vocabulary is that a word from the same root, with the same or similar meaning, should be common or exist in three out of four core languages: (General) English, (High) German, Dutch and Swedish/Norwegian/Danish. The Scandinavian languages are often counted as one language here, and a word wouldn't need to be common in more than one of these languages. Since many common words are often found in only two core languages at most, this method has not been proven sufficient for creating a complete Germanic auxiliary language. Several different methods have been elaborated to get cross the problem, including:
 Accept that a word only found in two different core languages should hold valid. This method would often create many synonyms.
 Using more common synonyms or compounds, such as "werk-schy"/"arbeid-schy" for lazy (work-shy).
 Using smaller, less common Germanic languages, including Low German, Afrikaans, Yiddish, Frisian, Icelandic.
 Using the word most common in Proto-Germanic.
 Referring to words common in other auxiliary languages or large language families (such as Interlingua or Slovio).


 Name .

"Folkspraak" has traditionally been what the language has been referred to as, but as different 'versions' of the language have different phonemic and graphemic realisations of historical phonemes, and also different capitalization and punctuation rules, the realisation of the name changes accordingly in each 'version'. Thus some would write "Folkspraak", others "Folksprak", "folk-spraak", "Folksprâk", "Folkspræk" etc. The basic form of the word is the Proto-Germanic roots "fulka-" (source of English "folk" and German "Volk") and "sprækijo" (source of "speech" and "Sprache") meaning "people" and "language" respectively. The compound thus means "people language", with the implication "language of the people" - it is debatable whether it would be better rendered with a genitive "-s" suffix on the "fulka-" element, thus yielding something of the form "Folksspraak" with the clear meaning "people's language". 

 Middelsprake .

There is also the related Inter-Germanic conlang Middelsprake, designed independently by Ingmar Roerdinkholder (now a member of the Folkspraak Yahoo! group). Middelsprake turned out to be rather close to Folkspraak. Some of the differences are that some of the 'versions' of Folkspraak include archaic orthography and phonology which are not present in the modern Germanic languages, and, compared to these versions, Middlesprake has a more regular and simple spelling and pronunciation, and to some extent grammar. 

Middelsprake is based on the comparison between eight living Germanic languages: English, German, Dutch, Danish, Swedish, Low Saxon, Frisian and Nynorsk Norwegian, and is an intermediate language between West Germanic and Scandinavian varieties. Test subjects have been able to understand almost completely at first sight, including people from Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden. Even English speakers can recognize a lot of their own wordstock in it.




 F lkspræk / Folksprak .

A 'version' of Folkspraak called F lkspræk (also called Meta-Folksprak and Boksprak) has been developed by Stephan Schneider. Its phoneme inventory is based on reconstructed Proto-Germanic. Diacritic signs are used in order to represent etymological and grammatical phenomena. For instance, the ring above u in the name  F lkspræk  shows a Proto Germanic u, which turned to o in at least one of the modern Germanic languages, such as English in this case (cf. folk).

Folksprak (N.B. single 'a') is based on F lkspræk, and therefore it is based in turn on Proto-Germanic. This means, it is not, unlike Middelsprake, a blend of modern Germanic languages, but an artificial (and hopefully thus logical, and indeed simple) member of the Germanic language family. Folksprak is nonetheless very similar in realisation to the "real" modern Germanic languages, because it features phoneme shifts following those seen in the development of modern Germanic (for instance, the Proto Germanic u in the word "F lkspræk" turns to o in Folksprak, as in modern Germanic). Folksprak uses the English alphabet plus two extra vowels: æ and ø.

This division into F lkspræk and Folksprak was supposed to help the Folkspraak-developers to focus both on Proto Germanic influences on Folkspraak and orthographic simplicity.

In theory, F lkspræk is able to represent any modern Germanic word (e. g. English mouse as mûs).

The Lord's Prayer.

As an example of Folkspraak in comparison to other Germanic languages, consider five proposed versions of the Lord's Prayer next to the Dutch, standard German and English prayer:

Rowan Cahill (born 1945) is an Australian radical historian and journalist with background as a teacher, and farmhand, and has variously worked for the trade union movement as a rank and file activist, delegate and publicist.  During the Vietnam War he was a conscientious objector, and was prominent in the anti-war, student protest, and New Left movements of the period, primarily as a publicist and communicator.  These activities led to him being placed under surveillance by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO).  Cahill has been widely published in socialist, trade  union, academic and mainstream publications; he has written numerous pamphlets and booklets, and is the author or co-author of three books, including a history of the militant Seamen's Union of Australia (1981).

The Church of Saint Andrew and St Paul is a Presbyterian church in downtown Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

It is the regimental church of The Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) of Canada.

This congregation is the 1918 merger of two congregations, both formed in the early years of the nineteenth century. 

St. Andrew's Church, Montreal was formed in 1802. It was the second such Presbyterian congregation, following the Scots Presbyterian Congregation, St. Gabriel Street Church, that began in 1787, became First PC in 1910, and is now part of Knox, Crescent, Kensington and First. 

Started in a room on Notre Dame Street, St. Andrew's was originally known as St. Peter's Street Church, and in 1820, became closer connected with the Church of Scotland. 
Buildings:
1806--St. Peter's Street;
1851-Building on Beaver Hall Hill;
1869-Building burned down and rebuilt.

In 1875, St. Andrew's remained out of the merger that joined Canadian Presbyterians; instead, remaining with the Church of Scotland until their merger with St. Paul's in 1918. 

St. Paul's Church, was formed in 1832, as a result of another conflict at the pioneer St. Gabriel Street Church, over the successor to Rev. James Somerville; between either Rev. Robert Easton, or Rev. Edward Black (both assistants to Sommerville). The conflict went over to Scotland, where it was encouraged that the Canadian Church of Scotland congregations form their own Synod to handle such matters. The result of this, in 1831, was to form a new congregation in Montreal and St. Paul's, under the leadership of Black was the miniority from St. Gabriel, placed under Easton.

In 1870, this building served as the meeting place for the delegates from the 4 Canadian Presbyterian groups, that eventually merged in 1875. St Paul's gained a few St. Andrew's families who were supportive towards the Presbyterian Church in Canada.

Buildings:
1834 Rue Ste Helene--owned by John Redpath and Peter McGill.
1867 on Dorchester Boulevard.  ;


St. Andrew and St Paul.
The present building was constructed on Sherbrooke Street at the corner of Redpath, and opened in 1932. It is in close proximity to McGill University, Concordia University (George Wlliams Campus) as well as the Guy-Concordia Metro station.

City West Link Road is a road in Sydney, Australia. It makes up a section of Metroad 4 between Leichhardt, Haberfield and Five Dock. As such, it provides an alternative route to Parramatta Road into Sydney's CBD from the Inner-West.

The City West Link, much to the dislike of some local residents, simply involved the upgrade of existing roads and streets to at least four lanes. The process was carried out in four stages:
Stage One: (December 1991) An underpass beneath Victoria Road was constructed.
Stage Two: (February 1993) Upgrades from The Crescent at Rozelle to Catherine Street at Lilyfield, using Brennan Street. This section used a temporary one-way system to deliver traffic to Lilyfield Road.
Stage Three: (May 1995) Dobroyd Parade and Wattle Street reconstruction was completed, providing four lanes between Parramatta Road and Hawthorne Canal.
Stage Four: (December 2000) Extended the road from Catherine Street to Dobroyd Parade. A new bridge was constructed over Hawthorne Canal. The City West Link then became part of Metroad 4, relieving a congested section of Parramatta Road.

Motorists began complaining early in 2004 that the road had already become congested, less than 4 years after opening. Most of the road is 4 lanes in width, whereas the section of Parramatta Road it replaced was mainly six lanes wide. Another issue with the road is that it ultimately feeds into Parramatta Road anyway. Thus congestion points on Parramatta Road have simply been moved to different areas rather than relieved altogether.

In 2005, a major bottleneck at the eastern end was removed. Previously eastbound traffic on the link had to merge from two lanes into one, just before joining Victoria Road west of the Anzac Bridge. There are now two lanes from the west link merging with the three from Victoria Road, to make four lanes over the Anzac Bridge.

The project is in some ways very similar to the South Eastern Arterial link in Melbourne, Australia. That road was built between two freeways, and ultimately had to be rebuilt without traffic signalled at-grade intersections. The only difference between the two is the available space for the Melbourne road allowed the conversion without any land resumption, whereas the City West Link Road is surrounded by properties which are in places only a few feet from the road edge. Like so many other new road projects in Sydney, the available land space and cash resources available lead to either too few traffic lanes, or at-grade intersections.

The New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority had plans to connect the City West Link to the M4 motorway, completely bypassing Parramatta Road. Included in the project was the removal of the at-grade intersections on the City West Link for through traffic. The plan was complicated, and involved building bridges for the City West Link Road to pass over at-grade intersections, some of which made provision for only one traffic lane in each direction. Residents and advocacy groups have voiced fears that this will worsen current congestion problems. The whole project was cancelled in late 2004.

Claude Bolling (born April 10, 1930), is a renowned French jazz pianist, composer, arranger, and occasional actor.

He was born in Cannes, studied at the Nice Conservatory, then in Paris.  A child prodigy, by age 14 he was playing jazz piano professionally, with Lionel Hampton, Roy Eldridge, and Kenny Clarke.

He has written music for over one hundred films, mostly French, starting with the score for a 1957 documentary about the Cannes Film Festival, and including the films Borsalino (1970), and California Suite (1979).

Bolling is also noted for a series of "crossover" collaborations with classical musicians.  His Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano Trio with Jean-Pierre Rampal, a clever and charming mix of Baroque elegance with modern swing, has been a top seller for many years, and was followed up by other works in the same vein. It was particularly popular in the United States, and it was at the top of the hit parade for two years after its release.

Following his work with Rampal, Bolling went on to work with many other musicians, from different genres, including Alexandre Lagoya, Pinchas Zukerman, Maurice André, and Yo-Yo Ma. He has also worked with, and performed tributes to many others, including Lionel Hampton, Duke Ellington, Stéphane Grappelli, Django Reinhardt, Oscar Peterson.

In mathematics, Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups is a basic theorem of functional analysis which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space H and one-parameter families of unitary operators

;

which are strongly continuous, that is 

;

and are homomorphisms:

;

Such  one-parameter families are ordinarily referred to as strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups.  The theorem is named after Marshall Stone who formulated and proved this theorem in 1932.

 Formal statement .

Let A be a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space H.  Then

;

is a strongly continuous one-parameter family of unitary operators.  The infinitesimal generator of t is the operator i A. This mapping is a bijective correspondence.

A will be a bounded operator iff the operator-valued function t   Ut is norm continuous.

 Example .

The family of translation operators

;

is a  one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator

;

defined on the space of complex-valued continuously differentiable functions of compact support on R.  Thus

;

 Applications and generalizations .
Stone's theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics. For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states H, time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on H.  The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian.

The Hille Yosida theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces.

Ratafia is a liqueur or cordial flavoured with peach or cherry kernels, bitter almonds, or other fruits; many different varieties are made.  The same name is given to a flavouring essence resembling bitter almonds, and also to a light biscuit. It is also a cordial made from a mix of marc brandy and the unfermented juice of the grape. 

The flavorings can potentially make this liqueur toxic, as peach and cherry kernels contain high levels of hydrogen cyanide (about 1.7 mg per gram of kernel), as do bitter almonds (2.5 mg/g)..  

The name 'ratafia' might be adapted from the French of the 17th century. Walter William Skeat (Etym. Dict., 1910) quotes as a possible origin a combination of Malay araq, arak, and tafia, rum. An alternative etymology proposes that the name derives from a custom of drinking to the ratification of a deal or treaty.

Peninsula Ridge Estates Winery in Beamsville, Ontario (Niagara Region) is currently the only Canadian producer of Ratafia.

Here's one criticism I have of the creationists' universe. Aside from the fact that it just ain't so, I mean. I tell people I don't accept the idea that there's anything supernatural, but there's also another dimension there. The created cosmos is ugly, poorly constructed and patched together, lacking in depth or size. It extends but a few thousand years past and future. Rather than brought into existence out of the very substance of the world, life is imposed by some external entity, forever foreign and out of place. The sufferings of creatures are meaningless to them and evil
because they are imposed by a being who doesn't have to do that. Far from uplifting, since you aren't supposed to
ask too much, the created universe is crass and materialistic, without subtlety or continuity, much like an automated
amusement park in which turning your head at the wrong time shows the wires leading to the animals' feet and the
wooden beams propping up the hollow rocks. Dead, false, dull. Unaesthetic.

<doc id="5260722" title="VirtualGL" nonfiltered="95" processed="93" dbindex="1480095">
VirtualGL is an open source program which redirects the 3D rendering commands from Unix and Linux OpenGL applications to 3D accelerator hardware in a dedicated server and displays the rendered output interactively to a thin client located elsewhere on the network.

The Problem.
Normally, VNC and other thin client environments for Unix and Linux either do not support running OpenGL applications at all or force the OpenGL applications to be rendered without the benefit of OpenGL hardware acceleration.  Remotely displaying 3D applications with hardware acceleration has traditionally required the use of "indirect rendering."  Indirect rendering uses the GLX extension to X Windows to encapsulate the OpenGL commands inside of the X Windows protocol stream and ship them over the network from the application server to an X Windows server running on the user's desktop.  All of the OpenGL commands are executed on the user's desktop, so the client machine must have a fair amount of CPU, memory, and graphics rendering horsepower.

Indirect rendering can be shown to perform well if the network is sufficiently fast (gigabit ethernet, for instance), if the application does not dynamically modify the geometry of the object being rendered, if the application uses display lists, and if the application does not use a great deal of texture mapping.  But many OpenGL applications do not meet these criteria.  To further complicate matters, it is often the case that OpenGL extensions, such as vertex/fragment programs, vertex arrays, etc. do not work in an indirect rendering environment.  Some of these extensions require the ability to directly access the 3D graphics hardware and thus can never be made to work indirectly.  In other cases, either the server's OpenGL library or the client's X server do not provide explicit support for the needed OpenGL extension, or the extension relies on a specific hardware configuration that is not present on the client machine.

Performing OpenGL rendering on the server circumvents the issues introduced by indirect rendering, since the application now has a fast and direct path to the 3D rendering hardware.  If the rendering occurs on the server, then only the resulting 2D images must be sent to the client.  Images can be delivered at the same frame rate regardless of how big the 3D data was that was used to generate them, so performing 3D rendering on the server effectively converts the 3D performance problem into a 2D performance problem.  The problem then becomes how to stream 1-2 megapixels of image data over a network at interactive frame rates.  But commodity technologies (HDTV, to name one) already exist to address this problem.

VirtualGL's Solution.
VirtualGL uses "GLX forking" to implement server-side OpenGL rendering.  Unix and Linux OpenGL applications normally send GLX commands to the X server to bind OpenGL rendering contexts to a particular X window, obtain a list of pixel formats that the X server supports, etc.  But if the X server is in fact a thin client proxy application (such as VNC) that doesn't support the GLX X Windows extension, then these applications will fail to execute.

VirtualGL takes advantage of a feature in Unix and Linux that allows one to "preload" a library into an application, effectively intercepting (AKA "interposing") certain function calls that the application would normally make to shared libraries with which it is linked.  Once VirtualGL is preloaded into a Unix or Linux OpenGL application, it intercepts the GLX function calls from the application and redirects them onto the server's X display, which presumably has a 3D hardware accelerator attached.  In the process of redirecting the GLX calls, VirtualGL also modifies the calls in order to force OpenGL rendering to occur in off-screen pixel buffers ("Pbuffers") rather than in X windows.  Meanwhile, the rest of the function calls from the application, including non-OpenGL X Windows calls, are allowed to pass through without modification.

Internally, VirtualGL's interposer engine also maintains a map of windows to Pbuffers, matches visual attributes between the destination X server and the X server on which the 3D rendering will occur, and performs a variety of other hashing functions to assure that the GLX redirection is seamless.  But essentially, once the OpenGL context is established on the server's display, VirtualGL gets out of the way and allows all subsequent OpenGL commands to pass through unimpeded to the server's 3D hardware.  Thus, the application can automatically use whatever OpenGL features and extensions are provided by the server's hardware and drivers.

Apart from marshalling GLX commands and managing Pbuffers, VirtualGL also reads back the rendered pixels at the appropriate time (usually by monitoring glXSwapBuffers() or glFinish()) and then draws those pixels into the appropriate X window using standard X image drawing commands.  Since VirtualGL is redirecting the GLX commands away from the destination X server, it can be used both to add 3D support to X proxies (such as VNC) which lack 3D support as well as to prevent indirect OpenGL rendering from occurring in a remote X display scenario.


Using VirtualGL in concert with VNC or another X proxy allows multiple users to simultaneously run 3D applications on a single server and multiple clients to share each session.  However, VNC and its ilk are tuned to handle 2D applications with large areas of solid color, few colors, and few inter-frame differences.  3D applications, on the other hand, generate images with fine-grained, complex color patterns and much less correlation between subsequent frames.  The workload generated by drawing rendered images from an OpenGL application into an X window is essentially the same workload as a video player, and off-the-shelf thin client software typically lacks sufficiently fast image codecs to be able to handle this workload with interactive frame rates.

VirtualGL works around this problem in two ways:

 TurboVNC;
 Direct Mode;

TurboVNC.
TurboVNC is an offshoot of TightVNC which accelerates the JPEG encoding paths of the latter by taking advantage of hand-tuned multimedia primitives from Intel and Sun Microsystems.  When used with VirtualGL, TurboVNC is capable of streaming the output of a full-screen (1280x1024) 3D application at greater than 15 frames/second with perceptually lossless image quality on 100 Megabit ethernet.  TurboVNC includes further optimizations to allow it to achieve 7-10 frames/second over broadband, with noticeable but usable image quality loss.  TurboVNC also extends TightVNC to include client-side double buffering and optimized binaries for Solaris.  TurboVNC and VirtualGL are used by the Texas Academic Computing Center at UT to allow users of the TeraGrid to remotely access the 3D rendering capabilities of the Maverick terascale visualization supercomputer.

Direct Mode.

In Direct Mode, VirtualGL compresses the rendered 3D images in process using the same optimized JPEG codec that TurboVNC uses.  VirtualGL then sends the compressed images directly to a VirtualGL Client application running on the client machine.  The VirtualGL Client is responsible for decompressing the images and drawing the pixels into the appropriate X window.  Meanwhile, the non-OpenGL elements of the application's display are sent over the network using the standard remote X Windows protocol and rendered on the client machine.

This approach requires that an X server be present on the client machine, and the reliance upon the remote X Windows protocol means that Direct Mode performs poorly on high-latency networks.  Additionally, Direct Mode does not inherently support collaboration (multiple clients per session), since the images are being pushed to the client rather than pulled from the server.  But Direct Mode does provide a completely seamless application experience, whereby every application window corresponds to a single desktop window.  Direct Mode also provides better performance than TurboVNC on local area networks and reduces the server CPU load, since the 2D rendering is now occurring on the client.

The developers of VirtualGL envision the primary users of Direct Mode to be laptop users connected to the 3D server with 802.11g wireless or fast ethernet.

The 156 began on the 23rd April 1983, the route served between Morden Station and Clapham Junction (Grant Road), the route can into action as parts of the 77A and M1 were withdrawn. The 156 was operated at Merton Garage (AL) and it was operated by DMS. The PVR was Monday to Saturday 12DMS and Sunday 6DMS. In October 1984 after 7:45pm the 156 terminated at Northcote instead of Grant Road, the PVR also changed in this year Monday to Friday 9DMS, Saturday 11DMS and Sunday stayed the same at 6DMS. 

By August 1985, the 156 was extended from Clapham Junction to Vauxhall (Monday- Friday Peaks only). The Monday to Friday PVR was increased to 18DMS, Saturday and Sunday was unchanged. 2 years later in July 1987, the Monday to Saturday service between Raynes Park to Morden was withdrawn and replaced by a new route (163). The route was Monday to Saturday Rayners Park to Clapham Junction. Monday to Friday Peaks Raynes Park to Vauxhall Station. Sunday journeys ran between Morden to Clapham Junction. Monday to Saturday allocation was transferred to Stockwell Garage (SW). The PVR changed again, Monday to Friday 16DMS, other days were not changed. 

2 years on, AL Sunday service was transferred to SW so the 156 was operated daily from Stockwell Garage, the PVR for Monday to Friday was decreased by 1 bus to make it 15DMS. By March 1991 the Sunday operation at AL was transferred back, but the Monday to Friday service was still at SW, they also started to introduce Metrobuses on the 156. The PVR was currently Monday to Friday 11DMS/M, Saturday 10DMS/M and Sunday 6DMS/M. 2 months later in May the allocation was back at AL full time, and was operated by DR's. It was withdrawn between Clapham Junction and Vauxhall, also between Wimbledon and Morden. So the 156 only operated from Clapham Junction to Wimbledon. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 9DR and Sunday 7DR. 

In 1994 AL allocated a Metrobus to the 156 for school journeys, also MRL's started appearing on the 156 with the DR's still operating. By 1996 the Metrobus was still going on the 156 but the DR buses were withdrawn so it was only operated by MRL's. 

When late 1997 came the contract was reassigned to Limebourne, it was being operated by Battersea Garage QB and the double decker school journey was being operated by Nostalgia Bus. The PVR was now Monday to Saturday 8SD, and Sunday 5SD, also 1 double decker Monday to Friday. In April 1999 the school journey double decker was transferred to Limebourne. Later on in 2001 Limebourne were taken over by Connex this was still operated at QB and a lot of the buses from Limebourne were now with Connex. The PVR was now 8DCL Monday to Saturday, Sunday 6DCL. A year later Connex converted the 156 to double deck which was being operated by Trident/Alexander's (TA's). The PVR was now increased 13TA Monday to Friday, Saturday 12TA and Sunday 10TA, from the end of 2002 the route was extended from Clapham Junction to Vauxhall. 

During 2004 Travel London took over Connex and they used the same garage and buses (TA's). The PVR is currently 13TA Monday to Friday, 12TA Saturday and 8TA Sunday's. The average journey time is between 35 and 65 minutes. The frequency for Monday to Saturday is every 10 minutes, Sunday and evenings are between every 15-20 minutes.

<doc id="914406" title="Giant Robo" nonfiltered="98" processed="96" dbindex="1480098">





, is a tokusatsu, anime and manga series created by Mitsuteru Yokoyama. It is similar to his famous manga/anime series, Tetsujin 28 (the OVA version of Giant Robo features characters from Tetsujin 28), only Giant Robo has more fantastic elements.

Johnny Sokko and his Flying Robot is the name given in the U.S. to the 26-episode tokusatsu (live-action) series based on Giant Robo, produced by Toei Company Ltd. in 1967. 

The later 7-episode OVA series was produced by Mu Films in an interval between 1992 and 1998, it is considered as one of the best of the "retro-anime" produced in the 1990s, and also one of the greatest anime series ever to be produced. It is available on six VHS tapes by Manga Video and three DVDs by Media Blasters.

The 1967 Series.
The original tokusatsu TV series aired on NET (now TV Asahi) from October 11, 1967 to April 1, 1968, with a total of 26 episodes.

Plot.

The Earth is under invasion by a terrorist group called Big Fire (Gargoyle in the US version), an illuminati style organization led by the alien Emperor Guillotine, who spends almost the entire series in a multicolored space ship hidden at the bottom of one of the Earth's oceans (presumably the Pacific) from where he issues his orders to the members of Gargoyle (frequently referred to in the series as "The Gargoyle Gang"). 

The members of Gargoyle, as it turns out, are an ambitious but somewhat incompetent bunch who appear to have a fairly high mortality rate due either to Unicorn actions or Guillotine's own fits of anger.  Their wardrobe is an interesting collection of what appears to be an assortment of castoffs from Soviet officers, wartime Wehrmacht personnel, Central American guerillas, and the designers of Italian sunglasses.  In addition, at least one Gargoyle member is always seen with a beatnik beard. Most of Gargoyle's members wear berets adorned with a skull on the front.  All members of Gargoyle have an explosive device implanted within their bodies that can be detonated in the event they're captured, though this seems to be used only rarely.

Guillotine himself has a large blue head with tentacles extending from the bottom of the head; not unlike Cthulhu.  He wears a long robe, and carries a staff with a white orb at its furthest end.  Like his head, the rest of his body is blue.  He is capable of growing to an enormous height, though this is only seen once in the series.

Guillotine leaves day-to-day matters in the hands of various commanders; principally Spider (a human who is eventually killed by a spray of acid), Doctor Botanus (Doctor Over in the Japanese series; a silver-skinned alien capable of teleportation), Fangar (Red Cobra in the Japanese series, and also alternatively referred to as Dangor the Executioner in the US series - a bizarre alien with a pegleg and crutch, a greatly enlarged forehead, protruding upper teeth, and a costume that looks like a traditional striped prison outfit in front and a red velvet jumpsuit in back), and Harlequin (Black Dia in the Japanese version, who has a fascination with the suits of playing cards).

The group captures scientists to create an army of giant monsters to rampage the Earth. But fate stumbles on a little boy named Daisaku Kusama (Johnny Sokko in the US) and a young man named J r  Minami (Jerry Mano in the US), the latter is secretly Member U3 of the top-secret peacekeeping organization, Unicorn. Daisaku and J r  are shipwrecked on an island after the ocean liner they were on was attacked by a giant sea monster called Dracolon, and are captured by members of Big Fire. When trying to escape, they end up in an elevator that leads down to a huge construction complex where a giant robot is being built. Pharaoh-like in appearance, this indestructible humanoid robot is being built by captive scientist Dr. Lucius Guardian, who decides to give the two escapees its control device, a miniature transmitter built into a wristwatch. The robot can only be controlled by the first voice that is recorded in its electronic brain (but he first needs to be charged up by atomic energy). Dr. Guardian helps Daisaku and J r  escape, only to be shot to death, but not before he set an atomic bomb that destroyed the base, the resulting explosion activates the giant robot, which moves to Daisaku's every command. As the controller of the robot (heretofore known as "Giant Robo," or just "Giant Robot" in the US), Daisaku is invited by J r  and his chief Azuma to join Unicorn as its 7th member, U7! As U7, Daisaku fights the evil forces of Big Fire with the help of U3/J r  and Giant Robo.

In the final episode Giant Robot directly confronts Guillotine, who has grown to the same size as Giant Robot.  Guillotine claims that his body at that size is capable of creating a nuclear explosion capable of wiping out the Earth, and demonstrates his power by ripping off one of his fingernails and producing a small nuclear explosion.  As the Earth hovers on the brink of surrender to Guillotine, Giant Robot - despite Daisaku's commands to the contrary - attacks Guillotine, picks him up, and flies into outer space, at which point Guillotine detonates, destroying both himself and Giant Robot.  The threat to Earth has been eliminated, but at the cost of Earth's greatest protector.



Weapons and functions.
The Giant Robot has numerous weapons systems which Johnny can command the robot use:
Finger missiles: Fired from the fingers with an undetermined number of rounds;
Back missile:  Fired from the back of the robot as the robot is lying on its chest facing toward its enemy.  The back missile is considerably larger and more destructive than the finger missiles.
Bazooka cannon:  A weapon which fires out of the top of the robot's head - not so much a bazooka as  a shower of sparks capable of blinding and disorienting an enemy.
Eye beams: A twinned energy blast from the eyes.
The center V on the chest can launch and ram against the enemy to force it back.  In addition, the robot's "belt buckle" contains a long pole which can be used to hook onto an enemy.

As a security precaution in case Johnny is forced to give unwanted orders, the boy can give a seeming line of gibberish into the communicator before doing so "Od ton yebo redro!", claiming it is a communication test.  However, the Robot is programmed to play the message backwards as "Do not obey order!"  With that message, the robot is programmed to take it as a signal that his controller is captured and regardless of any subsequent order, the Robot will launch and trace the signal to rescue his controller.

What's Robo Saying?.
It's generally known that Giant Robo doesn't speak, but every time Daisaku gives him a command, he responds with an echoing, roaring "MASSHHHH!!!"
(In the OVA , it lets out an echoing "AOOOOOOHHHHHHHMMMM!")

The US Version.
The entire series was first broadcast in the United States in 1969 and became quite popular in the next few years, particularly during the 1971 to 1973 period when it reached its peak in distribution and popularity. In 1970, several episodes were edited together to create the movie Voyage Into Space which has now reached cult film status.

While recently released on DVD by Toei Video in Japan (the entire series had also been available on laserdisc during the 1990s), the 26 episode series and the movie have never been officially released in the United States, with the exception of the first eight episodes, which were released on videocassette by Orion Home Video.  

Following Orion's folding into MGM, and MGM's purchase by Sony of America, the American rights to the series are now in the hands of Sony.  However, bootleg copies of the entire U.S. version of the series have long been available on both VHS and DVD.

The American version of the series was astonishingly violent by the standards of childrens' programming in the 1960s, and would certainly never pass muster today.  Guns and shooting are staples of every episode of the series, and the series' two child leads - Johnny Sokko and Mari Hanson (Mari Hanamura in the Japanese version; a 9-year-old girl introduced in the seventh episode who speaks 39 languages and is a crack shot with a firearm) - were frequently seen shooting along with the rest of the Unicorn agents.  In one episode Johnny and Mari are captured by Gargoyle, tied to two trees, and are within seconds of being executed by firing squad when Unicorn agents rescue them.  Oddly enough, though practically every Japanese anime exported to the United States during that period was edited due to violent content, Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot seems to have escaped close scrutiny in that regard, and what editing was done on the show seems to have been more for the purposes of squeezing in another commercial or two rather than in the interest of curbing the show's violence. 

It should be noted that in addition to dubbing American voice actors for the U.S. release, many of the show's sound effects were also remixed or re-recorded entirely.  And though the show's Japanese musical soundtrack was often used, it was frequently used in different places from the Japanese version of the series, or replaced altogether by a jazz-influenced score.  

Catherine Byers (aka Bobbie Byers), who provided Johnny Sokko's English language voice, has had a lengthy career since the 1960s.  She is also known for having voiced Captain Bonnie (Bokko) on the English language version of The Amazing 3, as well as Prince Planet on the series of the same name.  She appeared on-camera in two 1960s biker films; 1967's Wild Rebels and 1968's Savages from Hell.  Since then she has focused on voice acting (primarily talking books) and stage work.  Her Amazing 3 coworkers Neil Patrick, Paul Brown, Kurt Nagel, and Jerry Burke also provided various voices on Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot.

After Giant Robo.

Mitsunobu Kaneko (who had played Daisaku Kusama/Johnny Sokko in the original series) died in 1997.  His acting career appears to have completely ended after Giant Robo.  

Mitsuo Ando (Doctor Over/Doctor Botanus) also died in 1997, having spent his acting career playing various characters in children's shows.  

Japanese narrator Koichi Chiba died in 2001, having played a number of roles until the year before his death.  Interestingly, he was the only person associated with the 1966 series who was also involved with the OVA, voicing Dr. Franken Von Forglor.

Hideo Murota, who played the villain known as Black Dia/Harlequin, died of lung cancer in 2002, having spent his entire life following Giant Robo in a variety of film and TV roles.  It's fair to say that of all the series' regular actors, his career was the most successful.  

Akio Ito (Juro Minami/Jerry Mano) is reportedly now a production designer.

Yumiko Katayama (Mitsuko Nishino/Mitsuko Hino) also appeared in the 1969 Japanese TV series Playgirl.  Other than Giant Robo she is probably best remembered for having appeared in two of the early '70s "Pinky Violence" films; 1971's Zubeko bancho: zange no neuchi mo nai (Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess) and 1973's Zenka onna: koroshi-bushi (Criminal Woman: Killing Melody).  Her acting career appears to have ended after 1973.

Matasaburo Tamba (Spider) had played small roles in several movies prior to Giant Robo.  His only role of note following Giant Robo was as the villainous Black Shogun in the 1971 TV series Kamen Raida.  

The careers of the series' other actors appear to have ended entirely after the early '70s, if not before.

The OVA Series.

Plot.

Giant Robo takes place in 2049. It is a retro-esque future where the invention of the Shizuma Drive has brought about the third energy revolution, ascending mankind into an age of prosperity that began ten years ago. At that time, Dr. Shizuma and his four colleagues began to develop the drives. They were to be the perfect energy source; non-polluting and recyclable.

With this new revolution there came a heavy price...

Dr. Franken Von Forglor (transliterated as "Vogler" in the US ) , one of the five men who created the drives, went insane and activated an experimental reactor core that was being developed by the five scientists in their laboratory in Bashitarlle. A core meltdown ensued, causing a world-wide energy neutralization field and an explosion that resulted in the destruction of the entire city, and the loss of one third of the Earth's population. The event was entitled The Tragedy of Bashitarlle and became the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind.

Now Dr. Von Forglor, along with his associates, the would-be dictators called Big Fire, dispatch a giant orb to float across the world, draining the energy from all major cities and causing global chaos. The orb is powered by a new kind of Shizuma drive, of which only three examples exist.  Big Fire have two (both of which power the orb), and the Experts of Justice possess the third.  Big Fire would prefer to possess all three, but can operate the orb with only two.  The super-powered team which opposes the Experts of Justice are called "The Magnificent Ten". 

Against them are "The Experts of Justice," nine in number, a group of martial artists, scientific geniuses, and secret agents. Many of them have origins in Chinese folk hero tales, such as Tetsugyu, nicknamed "The Iron Ox". The One of them is youngster Daisaku Kusama (same name as in the live-action series above). Only the voice of Daisaku, the son of a scientist murdered by Big Fire, can control Giant Robo, a 90-foot tall war machine originally designed by Daisaku's father for Big Fire but now devoted to fight crime. 

Giant Robo is not presented as a machine to command in an aloof manner but as a team member to be included in the team spirit. It cries when it can't smash through a force field; Daisaku then abandons it for a time but returns to ask its help in the fight again. 

The only females in the story are GinRei ("Silver Bell"), an expert agent who wears a white Chinese dress; Yoshi Blue Face, an expert agent from Chinese mythology; and Sunny, the young daughter of the Magnificent Ten's Lord Alberto.


Production notes on the OVA.

The title of the OVA series is Giant Robo: The Animation, with the added subtitle GR: the Day the Earth Stood Still. Begun in 1992, the episodes of this OVA were produced intermittently due to the involvement of its director, Yasuhiro Imagawa, in other projects. Composer Masamichi Amano scored the grandiose musical themes for the project with the Warsaw Orchestra in Poland, considered by fans as some of his best work and a highlight of the series by itself. 

Besides Tetsujin 28, Imagawa pastiched other characters from Mitsuteru Yokoyama series, including characters from Godmars, Babel II, Sally, the Witch, Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Tales of the Water Margin/Suikoden (the last two retold the stories in two of the Four Classics of Chinese literature).

OVA Character and Other References.
Here's a partial list of the character and other references in the GR OVA:

Big Fire - The young leader of the Big Fire organization resembles the protagonist in Babel II (Babiru Nisei      );
Neptune - Poseidon (A giant robot, one of 3 protectors of Babel II);
Garuda - Lopross/Ropross (A giant "bird", protector of Babel II);
Achilles - Rodem (A shape-shifting talking black panther, protector of Babel II);
Koumei - K ngMíng (brilliant strategist from Romance of the Three Kingdoms);
Ryozanpaku - Liang Shan Po (location where the story of Water Margin took place);
Ko-Enshaku - A character from Water Margin;
 Sally - The main character of Sally the Witch. In this version, she's called Sunny, the name Yokoyama was originally going to use for her.

Many of the characters in the OVA were taken from various works by Yokoyama, including Tetsujin 28 (Gigantor).

Spin-off OVAs.

The Giant Robo OVA series spun off into three 30-minute videos (thought to be produced to distract the fans during the last-episode hiatus of the original), all of them starring the beautiful secret agent GinRei (  ). The plots and situations of these episodes are more comedy-oriented and tongue-in-cheek than the original series. These videos are:

Barefoot GinRei Episode.1 Find the stolen Chinese Dress!! (1994);
(Japanese Title:    GinRei Episode.1                 !!)

Steel-Armed Ginrei Episode.23 Forbidden Fruit ~ War in Heaven!! (1995);
(Japanese Title:   GinRei Epidode.23                 !!)

GinRei with Blue Eyes (1995) (Japanese Title:       );

On May 17, 2005, these videos were released officially on DVD by Media Blasters Studio.

The 2007 Series.

A third Giant Robo series consisting of 13 episodes will begin being broadcast in the spring of 2007. It was reported that a 2nd or 3rd season would follow sometime 2008. Souce.

Ben Franklin in Paris is a Broadway musical with a book and lyrics by Sidney Michaels and music by Mark Sandrich, Jr.. Additional songs were contributed by Jerry Herman.


The story is a somewhat fictionalized account of Benjamin Franklin's adventures in the French capital. Seeking support for the Colonies' war against England, he arrives in Paris, where he enlists the aid of an old friend, Madame La Comtesse Diane de Vobrillac, a confidante to King Louis XVI. Franklin's hopes of winning the king's support seem dashed when British forces capture Philadelphia but rally when the Colonists are victorious at Saratoga. At home, his son William, the governor of New Jersey, sides with the enemy, and the traitorous act upsets the elder Franklin's plans. To regain the upper hand, he offers to marry Diane, but she rejects him. Knowing he faces death by hanging, Franklin nevertheless decides to go to England, hoping his act of martyrdom will win him  posthumous support. Diane learns of the plan and intercedes with the King, who eventually welcomes Franklin in his new position of the Ambassador of the United States of America to France.


After 13 previews, the show - directed and choreographed by Michael Kidd - opened on October 27, 1964 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 215 performances. The cast included Robert Preston and Susan Watson. Michaels was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Author of a Musical. 

An original cast recording was released by Capitol Records.

Voorne-Putten is an island between the North Sea, the Brielse meer and the rivers Oude Maas, Spui and Haringvliet in the province of South Holland in the Netherlands. Voorne-Putten consists of the two former islands Voorne (the larger, western part) and Putten (the smaller, eastern part). Since a few years they are separated again by the river Bernisse, which has been dredged. The North Sea coast of Voorne is a valuable nature reserve (sand dunes). The rest of the island is a mostly agricultural region. The largest town, Spijkenisse, in the east of the island, is more or less a suburb of Rotterdam. 

Voorne-Putten consists of the following municipalities:

 Bernisse (towns Geervliet and Heenvliet, villages Abbenbroek, Oudenhoorn and Zuidland);
 Brielle (town Brielle, villages Vierpolders and Zwartewaal);
 Hellevoetsluis;
 Spijkenisse (town Hekelingen);
 Westvoorne (villages Oostvoorne, Rockanje and Tinte);

Voorne-Putten is separated
from the island of Rozenburg on the north by the Brielse meer (dam and bridge);
from IJsselmonde island on the north-east by the Oude Maas (bridge and metro tunnel);
from Hoeksche Waard island on the south-east by the Spui (ferry);
from Goeree-Overflakkee island on the south by Haringvliet (dam);

Talena A. L. Atfield (born January 14, 1983) is a Canadian bass guitar player. She is 5.6 ft tall. She has played in Kittie, Why she left Kittie: the official statements:The band states "We are so sad and disappointed that Talena chose to leave the band. We wish she would have stayed with us, but we view it as an opportunity for a new beginning and promise our fans a more mature and ferocious band with the addition of Arroyo on bass." 

There are many rumors about why Talena left the band, as there are with Fallon, but this is what was quoted by Talena on her official message board:

"I would like to clear something up, the money wasn't an issue for me and that was not the reason for my departure, they replaced me before I even left. They gave me an ultimatum, to sign something I was unable to sign because it did not benefit me in the least and did not give me control over myself, they said to sign it or leave because they had already found someone new to play bass. And that right there was enough for me to decide on, if they could replace me that quickly without even talking to me then they obviously didn't want me there anyways. They can state whatever reasons they want for me leaving. They don't even know why because they never even called me to talk to me about it, they had Jeff call me to tell me the news, and I am sure it makes them look better if I am a "money grubbing whore" or so they have been saying." -TALENA ATFIELD

According to Morgan and Mercedes, they had called Talena's house to set up band practice for the up coming tour and her father told them that she did not want to be in the band any more. According to the two sisters, they had no intentions of kicking her out of the band.  They were very surprised that Talena had to get her dad to tell them she was quitting the band.  

Talena was forced to return a BC Rich Custom Widow 5-stringed bass when she had left Kittie, but still has shown an extreme liking for the ESP-LTD bass line series which she later sold on e-Bay to a fan by the name Nick aka misfits

Allegedly, it was also revealed earlier in 2005 that Talena didn't play many of her bass lines on Oracle.  Her tracks were sloppy and Morgan later fixed them at the request of producer Garth Richardson.

Talena is currently a member of Amphibious Assault along with former Kittie member Fallon Bowman. Together they both have left the world of hard rock in favor of the industrial sound.

 Talena is named after a princess from John Norman's "Chronicles of Gor" book series that her father read. ;
 She currently lives in London, Ontario. ;
 She has a younger brother named Griffin. ;

Mummy Mountain is the second highest peak of the Spring Mountains in Nevada.

It takes its name from its vague resemblance to a mummy, or perhaps more accurately an Egyptian sarcophagus seen in profile, with the "head" to the north formed by outcropping above Lee Canyon, the gently rounded main summit forming the "body", and a southern rise and cliffs forming the "feet". This appearance is especially prominent from U.S. Route 95, which passes by the mountain to the east.

The usual route to the summit is from the North Loop Trail to Mount Charleston, starting from where it reaches close to the top of the ridge between Mummy and Charleston. A steep scramble up a scree slope reaches the top of the ridge, where a faint climber's trail leads east to the base of the summit cliffs. The route then jogs north to a chute leading to the broad and flat summit plateau.

Ranunculus lapponicus (the Lapland buttercup) is distributed all over the arctic, with the exception of northern and eastern Greenland.

It is a low, prostrate plant with a creeping, underground stem (rhizome) which sends out long stalks and shoots bearing the flowers. The leaves are deeply tripartite, forming 3 lobes which are toothed or crenated. The flowers are yellow, solitary, generally having 6 (8) petals that are distinctly longer than the sepals. After flowering, the fruit forms a globular head of carpels held above the creeping plant. 

It grows in wet localities, especially in moss carpets along beaches, streams and lakes.

Interchange File Format (IFF), is a generic file format originally introduced by the Electronic Arts company in 1985 (in cooperation with Commodore-Amiga) in order to ease transfer of data between software products produced by different companies.  

IFF files do not have any common extension. Most files with .iff extension are in fact ILBM files, wrongly named so because they are most common IFF files and most assume that they are the only type of IFF files (on many systems that produce IFF files, file extensions are not important).

Structure.

An IFF file is built up from chunks. Each chunk begins with what the spec calls a "Type ID" (what the Macintosh called an OSType and Windows developers might call a FourCC). This is followed by a 32-bit unsigned integer (all integers in IFF files' structure are big-endian) specifying the size of the following data (the chunk content) in bytes. Because the spec includes explicit lengths for each chunk, it is possible for a parser to skip over chunks which it either can't or doesn't care to process. 

There are predefined group chunks, with type IDs  FORM ,  LIST  and  CAT  . A FORM chunk is like a record structure, containing a type ID (indicating the record type) followed by nested chunks specifying the record fields. A LIST is a factoring structure containing a series of  PROP  (property) chunks plus nested group chunks to which those properties apply. A CAT  is just a collection of nested chunks with no special semantics. Group chunks can contain other group chunks, depending on the needs of the application. Group chunks, like their simpler counterparts, contain a length element. Skipping over a group can thus be done with a simple Unix-style relative seek operation.

Chunks must begin on even file offsets, as befits the origins of IFF on the Motorola 68000 processor, which couldn't address quantities larger than a byte on odd addresses. Thus a chunk following an odd-length chunk will be preceded by a pad byte.

The top-level structure of an IFF file consists of exactly one of the group chunks: FORM, LIST or CAT .

Each type of chunk typically has different internal structure, that could be numerical data, text, or raw data. It is also possible to include other IFF files as if they are chunks (note that they have the same structure: four letters followed with length) and some formats use this. There are standard chunks that could be present in any IFF file, such as  AUTH  (containing text with information about author of the file),  ANNO  (containing text with annotation, usually name of the program that created the file),  NAME  (containing text with name of the work in the file),  VERS  (containing file version),  (c)   (containing text with copyright information). There are also chunks that are common among a number of formats, such as  CMAP  which holds color palette in ILBM, ANIM and DR2D files (pictures, animations and vector pictures). There are chunks that have common name but hold different data such as  BODY  which could store image in an ILBM file and sound in an 8SVX file. And finally, there are chunks unique to their file type. Some programs that create IFF files add to them chunks with their internal data; these same files can later be read by other programs without any disruption (because their parsers could skip uninteresting chunks) which is a great advantage of IFF and similar formats.

As a nestable, descriptive file format, there are architectural similaries to XML. XML, however, is primarily a text format, whereas all IFF contains at least some binary data (the length fields). It is possible to mechanically convert IFF to an XML equivalent; however, XML has additional features such as descriptive data and metadata (attributes, entities, DTD's and schemas) and navigational features (xpath) which cannot be trivially mapped back to IFF.

List of common IFF-based file formats.
8SVX (Audio format);
ACBM (Amiga Contiguous BitMap - Image format for very fast loading/saving);
AIFF (Audio format);
ANBM ((obsolete) animation format, interally a set of ILBMs to be displayed one-after-another);
ANIM (Animation format);
BIFF8 (formerly used by Microsoft Excel);
Alias/Wavefront Maya file format (both image and scene description);
Word document (pre Word 97 format);
DjVu (Image format for high resolution compound documents);
DR2D;
EMOD (QuadraComposer module format);
FNTR (Raster font);
FNTV (Vector font);
FTXT (Text format);
GSCR (apocryphal (?) General music Score);
IFRS (known as Blorb);
IFZS (known as Quetzal);
ILBM (Raster image format);
PDEF (Deluxe Print page definition);
PICS (Macintosh QuickDraw picture encapsulated in IFF format);
PLBM ((obsolete) picture format);
SHRI;
SMUS (Simple Music format, similar to MIDI format);
USCR (Uhuru Sound music score);
UVOX (Uhuru Sound voice);
VDEO (Deluxe Video Construction Set video);
YAFA (Animation Format);

Clones and variants of the IFF format.
 RIFF is a variant of IFF format devised by Microsoft and IBM; RIFF files differ from IFF files in that they have letters RIFF at the beginning and use little-endian integers. WAV files, for example, are RIFFs. A big-endian version, RIFX, has also been defined but found no significant use.
 AVI files are also RIFF-based;
 The TIFF file format was designed by Aldus to include high-depth bitmaps with PostScript.  It has a chunked structure similar to IFF, however the image format itself has no relationship to the ILBM format.
 The Standard MIDI File format takes the key concepts of IFF without actually using the IFF standard.
 The PNG file format takes the concept of chunks from IFF, but does not copy the exact structure.
 QuickTime (.mov) files (and hence the derived MPEG-4 files) took the same concept of chunks from IFF, but calls them 'atoms' and uses a different layout. They also have extensions for chunks over 4GB in size.

Stranorlar (Srath an Urláir in Irish) is a small town in County Donegal which forms one of the "twin towns" of Stranorlar/Ballybofey on either side of the River Finn.

For nearly 100 years, Stranorlar was the headquarters of the County Donegal Railway system (originally, the Finn Valley Railway), with services to Derry and Letterkenny via Strabane (near Castlefin), to Ballyshannon and Killybegs via Donegal, and to Glenties. At its peak the railway had 130 employees. The last train ran from Stranorlar in 1961.

Stranorlar is home to Stranorlar Vocational School and St. Columbas College, both highly rated secondary schools. There is an interesting old Church of Ireland church, the Catholic church of St Mary's, and there are 2 Presbyterian churches. Finn Valley Athletics Club has its track in the town. There is an excellent 18 hole golf course and fine game fishing in the river Finn, and nearby is the Lough Alann bird sanctuary.

There is an old rhyme which goes "Belmafey for drinkin' tae, Stranorlar for drinking brandy."

Jengish Chokusu  is the highest mountain in the Tian Shan mountain range. It lies on the Kyrgyzstan-China border, in the Kokshaal-Too subrange, the highest part of the Tien Shan, southeast of lake Issyk Kul.

 Names .
The mountain's official name in Kyrgyz is Jengish Chokosu, which means "Independence". During the Soviet era its Russian name was Pik Pobedy (or Peak Pobeda), meaning "Victory Peak". In Uighur, it is called Tömür, which is also the official name of the mountain in China. The Chinese name Tu mù' r F ng      is a transcription of the Uighur. 

 Description .
Jengish Chokusu is a massif, with several summits along its lengthy ridge. Only its main summit breaks 7,000 m. It is located 16 km (10 miles) southwest of Khan Tengri (7,010 m / 22,998 ft), separated by the South Engilchek (or Inylchek) glacier, where base camps for both mountains are usually located. The massif runs at right angles to the glaciers it spills into three alpine valleys on the north (Kyrgyzstan), all eventually running to the Engilchek glacier, the largest in the Tian Shan. Its main summit is usually approached from the Zvozdochka (Russian for "little star") glacier, which is coloured red with rocks from Jengish Chokusu.

Records.
Jengish Chokusu is the highest mountain in the Tian Shan, and the highest one in Kyrgyzstan. Jengish Chokusu has the most northerly 7,000-metre rock in the world, and by geologists is considered the most northerly 7,000-metre mountain. (Because mountains often contain ice caps on top of rock, mountaineers consider Khan Tengri, the Tian Shan's second highest peak, as the northernmost 7,000-metre summit.)

The South Inylchek (Enylchek) Glacier and its side glaciers occupy the entire north side of Peak Jengish Chokusu.  This glacier, currently at 62 km in length, is the fourth longest outside of the world's polar regions. 

History.
Although Jengish Chokusu is almost 1,500 ft higher, Khan Tengri was believed to be the highest peak in the range until Jengish Chokusu's survey in 1946. Jengish Chokusu's first verified ascent was in 1956 by Vitaly Abalakov's party though there are unsubstantiated reports of a successful 1939 attempt as well. The mountain was renamed Victory (Pobeda) Peak short after the USSR's victory in the Great Patriotic War (World War II). It was officially renamed Jengish Chokusu after Kyrgyz Independence but retains Pobeda as its colloquial name.

The first winter ascent of the peak was made by Valery Khrichtchatyi in February 1990.

<doc id="8340321" title="Liz Lemon" nonfiltered="117" processed="115" dbindex="1480117">


Elizabeth "Liz" Lemon is a fictional character played by Tina Fey on the American television series 30 Rock.

Personal history.


In "Jack Meets Dennis," Liz stated that she was from somewhere called "White Haven," possibly referring to White Haven, Pennsylvania, and dialogue in the episodes "Tracy Does Conan" and "Jack Meets Dennis" suggest she was born around November, 1971. In college, she studied theater tech. She and Jenna Maroney knew each other well as early as 1996 and together dreamed of making it big. They shared an apartment in a Chicago neighborhood called "Little Armenia" and began The Girlie Show on Second City. At that time, the show apparently starred both of them.

Liz and Jenna worked for years to turn The Girlie Show into a television series, the pair of them even having to move from Chicago to New York City for it. Liz became the head writer and apparently the unofficial show runner for The Girlie Show while Jenna became the show's main star. It is not known when the television version of The Girlie Show started, but it was apparently after the year 2000 and the show had evidently run long enough to successfully find a fanbase by the time of the pilot episode. Liz and the writers apparently had a good relationship with their boss Gary, who was stated to love the show and be pleased with the ratings.

However, Gary's death is announced in the pilot and Jack Donaghy takes his place. Jack immediately decides to retool the show to make it appeal to a larger demographic, starting by firing her trusted producer Pete Hornberger and making her hire unpredictable actor Tracy Jordan as the show's new star. Liz manages to convince Jack to re-hire Pete, but Jack is insistent on making the show center around Tracy and, much to Liz's chagrin, he renames the show TGS with Tracy Jordan.

Personality.
Jack's overview.
Liz Lemon is presumably a parody of Tina Fey herself or, possibly, her media image. In the pilot episode, Jack, at a mere glance, described her, apparently accurately, as a "New York third-wave feminist, college-educated, single-and-pretending-to-be-happy-about-it, overscheduled, undersexed, you buy any magazine that says 'healthy body image' on the cover and every two years you take up knitting for...a week." Pete said that the "knitting" part, in particular, was uncanny.

Physical appearance and typical attire.
In contrast with her friend and likely foil Jenna Maroney, Liz seems to have little interest in stereotypical female interests such as fashion. Her "bi-curious" shoes led Jack to erroneously think she was gay and set her up on a blind date with his friend Gretchen Thomas, the "brilliant plastics engineer/lesbian" in "Blind Date." Except when she is pressured to dress more femininely, she appears in unfashionable, gender-neutral attire. Due to this, Jack very clearly does not find her at all attractive, as he repeatedly makes clear through backhanded compliments.

Liz almost always appears wearing plastic-rimmed glasses and the flashbacks from the episode "Blind Date" reveal that she has worn glasses since she was about four or five at least. However, according to Jenna in "The Rural Juror," she does not actually need glasses. This is probably intended to parody the fact that plastic-rimmed glasses are considered to be Tina Fey's trademark in real life, despite the fact that she does not actually need glasses except to see far away.

Quirks and interests.
Liz is generally portrayed as something of a geek, so, although apparently a skilled writer, she seems to have precious few social skills, as demonstrated in "The Break-Up" where, while she was trying to meet a date at a karaoke bar, a man asked her if the seat next to her was taken and she asked him why she should move her coat just so he could sit there. She is apparently a fan of Star Wars (often using events from the original trilogy to explain her feelings and actions in daily life) and Heroes ("I like the Japanese dude."), and her drink of choice is Pinot Grigio ("Blind Date", "The Head and the Hair"). She is allergic to dogs and has evidently won at least one Emmy Award. Liz also speaks fluent German.

Liz has a strong aversion to unfairness and breaking rules as demonstrated in the opening scene of the pilot, where, when a man cheats to get a hot dog from a hot dog stand more quickly by "creating" a new line which several people from the "original" line promptly join, she responds by buying all the hot dogs and giving them to the "good people" who stayed in the original line. Later, when Liz considered quitting over Jack's changes to the show, Pete told her that she had the best job in New York and that she shouldn't, in his words, "buy all the hot dogs."

She also seems to have a weakness when it comes to maternal instincts. In "The Baby Show," the day after Liz told Jenna that she wanted to have children, she found herself bombarded with offers from people who wanted to be sperm donors or surrogates for her. Liz was also asked by a makeup artist to hold her baby daughter while she was doing touch ups on Jenna, but, after leaving Jenna's dressing room, Liz blacked out and found herself standing in her apartment, still holding the baby in her arms, thanks to the baby's hypnotic effect on her.

Political beliefs.
As demonstrated in several encounters with Jack, she seems to have left-wing politics and is most likely a Democrat. In "Jack-tor," she is shown to be somewhat afflicted with "white guilt," which Tracy uses to manipulate her in the episode. She later says that her white guilt "is to be used only for good, like overtipping and supporting Barack Obama."

Relationships.
Jenna Maroney.
Liz stated in the pilot that she and Jenna worked for years to get The Girlie Show and a series of flashbacks in "The Rural Juror" reveal that Liz and Jenna have known each other since at least 1996, having been roomates together in a Chicago neighborhood called "Little Armenia". Given Jenna's uptight nature, Liz is generally forced to act as her rock. This has caused Liz some annoyance, especially after Jack increased Jenna's stress level and paranoia by hiring Tracy and changing the show's name.

Liz has been seen complaining about Jenna's erratic tendencies behind her back, usually with Pete. In "The Aftermath," Jenna got mad at Liz when she overheard Liz describe her to Tracy as being "paranoid" and "neurotic." Jenna once slept with Liz's brother Mitch and said he was terrible in bed. (Liz says Mitch hasn't been right since he was in some kind of skiing accident.)

Pete Hornberger.
Liz and Pete have known each other since about 1996 and he's possibly the closest thing Liz has to a confidant, especially since Jenna, her closest female friend, is far too anxious about her own life to function as such. Liz seems to have more genuine respect for him than anyone else on the show.

Tracy Jordan.
Liz has not really tried to pursue a relationship of any kind with Tracy, preferring to focus her energies on keeping his craziness in check. She is typically friendly towards him, though mainly to further this end. She refers to him by his first name, whereas he calls her by her last name, "Lemon," or by her full name, "Liz Lemon."

Jack Donaghy.
Liz, unsurprisingly, does not particularly like Jack Donaghy, though, to his face, she is generally respectful of his authority, though she has dared to be rather sarcastic on a few occasions, most notably when first meeting him in the pilot. The degree of her dislike for him tends to vary from time to time. Like Tracy, he usually refers to her as "Lemon." When addressing him, she usually calls him "sir," though, if he's being particularly intimate, which he has tendency to be, she has been known to call him by his first name. When referring to him, she has been shown to call by his first name, last name or full name.

Love life.

According to Pete in "Blind Date," Liz has had some really terrible boyfriends in the ten years that he's known her. She apparently used to date Conan O'Brien, who told Liz that he wants to forget their brief relationship. Liz was dating Dennis Duffy, her on-again-off-again boyfriend, until the episode "The Break Up," in which she learned that he was an online sexual predator after seeing him on Dateline NBC, where he was caught in one of their hidden camera investigations.

In "The Head and the Hair," Liz and Jenna considered hooking up with two men who they had nicknamed "The Head" and "The Hair," referring to one them being intelligent, but lacking good looks and vice-versa. However, Liz was surprised when she was approached by "The Hair" (whose real name turned out to be Gray) since she had assumed that she was meant for "The Head." Despite a rocky start, their relationship went fairly well until Liz and Gray discovered that they were third cousins.

List of pros and cons on Dennis.
 
In "The Break Up", Jenna suggests that Liz make a list of pros and cons about Dennis to help her to decide to break up with him or not. Her pros and cons on him were as follows:


 Pros;
 Basically nice;
 Takes good care of his feet;
 Makes good chili;
 Remembers my birthday;
 Rarely wants to do it;
 Is funny when he goofs on his friends;
 Doesn't care about money;
 Loyal;
 Too lazy to cheat;
 Would increase likelihood of blue-eyed kids;
 Loves The Simpsons;
 Has good hair;
 Has already seen me throw up twice;
 Fixed TV;
 Jack likes Dennis;

 Cons;
 Not super smart;
 Listens to Winger;
 Dental hygiene;
 Wears acid wash denim;
 Always wants foot rubs;
 Not much money;
 Catholic;
 Doesn't like his mother;
 I don't like his mother;
 His mother doesn't like me;
 Loves Family Guy;
 Reads The Post;
 Insists on spending holidays with his mother;
 Has already seen me throw up;
 Attempted three-way;
 Racist;
 Wears Italian cross even though Irish;
 Jack likes Dennis;
 Sexual predator  ;


    After seeing the NBC Dateline show, Liz writes his appearance on it as a con but the camera never shows exactly what she writes but surely is about him being a sexual predator of a minor.

Her name.
Interestingly, her full first name, Elizabeth, is also Tina Fey's full first name, though Conan O'Brien is, so far, the only "character" to refer to her as "Elizabeth" rather than "Liz." Her last name, "Lemon," is apparently intended to imply an acerbic personality and possibly also to make her full name alliterative.

Equity feminism is a phrase coined by Christina Hoff Sommers in her book Who Stole Feminism? (Simon & Schuster, 1994) as opposed to the term gender feminism. It's used to describe an ideology that aims for full civil and legal equality and distinguish it from the term gender feminism, which she uses to describe the idea of much of modern academic feminist theory and the feminist movement which aims at the total abolition of gender roles and structure of the society which they claim is still dominated by patriarchal structures. Hoff Sommers considers this as gynocentrism and misandry that she feels is dominant in the contemporary feminist movement. Christina Hoff Sommers argues, "Most American women subscribe philosophically to the older 'First Wave' kind of feminism whose main goal is equity, especially in politics and education" . Although she realizes that her views are not mainstream in academia or the feminist movement in general, she considers them mainstream among the US population of women .

Caso Cerrado is a Latin American television "judge show" broadcasted on Telemundo and hosted by Cuban judge Ana María Polo.  The show was previously called Sala de Parejas (Couple's Court) in 2005.  

In the show, Polo presented several cases between conflicting guests and she tries to solve the situations as an arbitrator. Her function on the show is not that of a judge but an arbitrator who settles differences between her guests (the litigants).

The guests of the show all come voluntarily and are requested to sign legally binding contracts before appearing. The decisions she makes are legally binding and can be legally enforced.

In hydrology, moisture recycling or precipitation recycling refer to the process by which a portion of the precipitated water that evapotranspired from a given area contributes to the precipitation over the same area. Moisture recycling is thus a component of the hydrologic cycle. The ratio of the locally derived precipitation () to total precipitation () is known as the recycling ratio, : .

The recycling ratio is a diagnostic measure of the potential for interactions between land surface hydrology and regional climate . Land use changes, such as deforestation or agricultural intensification, have the potential to change the amount of precipitation that falls in a region. The recycling ratio for the entire world is one, and for a single point is zero. Estimates for the recycling ratio for the Amazon basin range from 24% to 56%, and for the Mississippi basin from 21% to 24% .

The Canadian Environmental Protection Act of 1999 is "An Act respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and human health in order to contribute to sustainable development."

The goal of the renewed Canadian Environmental Protection Act (CEPA) is to contribute to sustainable development through pollution prevention and to protect the environment, human life and health from the risks associated with toxic substances. 

CEPA also recognises the contribution of pollution prevention and the management and control of toxic substances and hazardous waste to reducing threats to Canada's ecosystems and biological diversity. 

It acknowledges for the first time the need to virtually eliminate the most persistent toxic substances that remain in the environment for extended periods of time before breaking down and bioaccumulative toxic substances that accumulate within living organisms. 

Health Canada works in partnership with Environment Canada to assess potentially toxic substances and to develop regulations to control toxic substances. Some of the highlights of the new act include:

Petar Brzica was a Croatian fascist and World War II war criminal. He was a member of the Croatian fascist Ustaša organization and one of the guards in the Jasenovac concentration camp. He is known for having been the winner of a slaughtering contest, in which he killed about 1300 concentration camp prisoners in a single night, using a curve-bladed knife.

After World War II he fled to the United States. Yugoslav authorities were never able to capture him and he most likely changed his identity and died hidden. His name was on a list of 59 Nazis living in the US given by a Jewish organization to the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the 1970s. As of 2006, Brzica has remained unrevealed.

A heuristic is a replicable method or approach for directing one's attention in learning, discovery, or problem-solving. It is originally derived from the Greek "heurisko" (), which means "I find". (A form of the same verb is found in Archimedes' famous exclamation "eureka!"   "I have found !") The term was introduced in the 4th century CE by Pappus of Alexandria.

The study of heuristics is sometimes called heuristic, but more often called heuristics. Heuristics, in this sense, is treated as a singular, like physics or mathematics.

The mathematician George Pólya popularized heuristics in the mid 20th century, in his book How to Solve It. He learned mathematical proofs as a student but he did not know, nor was he taught, the ways mathematicians arrived at such proofs. How to Solve It is a collection of ideas about heuristics that he taught to mathematics students   ways of looking at problems and formulating solutions.

How to Solve It describes the following common and simple heuristics, which serve as useful illustrative examples:
 If you are having difficulty understanding a problem, try drawing a picture.
 If you can't find a solution, try assuming that you have a solution and seeing what you can derive from that ("working backward").
 If the problem is abstract, try examining a concrete example.
 Try solving a more general problem first (the "inventor's paradox": the more ambitious plan may have more chances of success).

The word is used adjectivally ("Is it heuristic?") in relation to research or intellectual pursuits.  For example, a good theory or idea may be heuristic in that it attempts to find something out or stimulates further investigation.  When criticizing theories in the sciences good theories tend to be heuristic.

Psychology.
In psychology, heuristics are simple, efficient rules, hard-coded by evolutionary processes or learned, which have been proposed to explain how people make decisions, come to judgments, and solve problems, typically when facing complex problems or incomplete information. These rules work well under most circumstances, but in certain cases lead to systematic cognitive biases.

For instance, people may tend to perceive more expensive beers as tasting better than inexpensive ones. This finding holds true even when prices and brands are switched; putting the high price on the normally relatively inexpensive brand is enough to lead subjects to perceive it as tasting better than the beer that is normally more expensive. One might call this "price implies quality" bias. (Cf. Veblen good.)

Much of the work of discovering heuristics in human decision-makers was ignited by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman, who together had an important influence on behavioral finance. Critics led by Gerd Gigerenzer focus on how heuristics can be used to make judgments that are in principle accurate, rather than producing cognitive biases   heuristics that are "fast and frugal".

Philosophy.
In philosophy, especially in Continental European philosophy, the adjective "heuristic" (or the designation "heuristic device") is used when an entity X exists to enable understanding of, or knowledge concerning, some other entity Y. A good example is a model, which, as it is never identical with what it models, is a heuristic device to enable understanding of what it models. Stories, metaphors, etc., can also be termed heuristic in that sense. A classic example is the notion of utopia as described in Plato's best-known work, The Republic. This means that the "ideal city" as depicted in the The Republic is not given as something to be pursued, or to present an orientation-point for development; rather, it shows how things would have to be connected, and how one thing would lead to another (often with highly problematic results), if one would opt for certain principles and carry them through rigorously.

Law.
In legal theory, especially in the theory of law and economics, heuristics are used in the law when case-by-case analysis would be impractical.

For instance, in the United States the legal drinking age is 21, because it is argued that people need to be mature enough to make decisions involving the risks of alcohol consumption. However, assuming people mature at different rates, the specific age of 21 would be too late for some and too early for others. In this case, the somewhat arbitrary deadline is used because it is impossible or impractical to tell whether one individual is mature enough that society can trust them with that kind of responsibility.

The same reasoning applies to patent law. Patents are justified on the grounds that inventors need to be protected in order to have incentive to invent. It is therefore argued that, in society's best interest, inventors should be issued with a temporary government-granted monopoly on their product, so that they can recoup their investment costs and make economic profit for a limited period of time. In the United States the length of this temporary monopoly is 20 years from the date the application for patent was filed, though the monopoly does not actually begin until the application has matured into a patent. However, like the drinking-age problem above, the specific length of time would need to be different for every product in order to be efficient; but a 20-year term is used because it is difficult to tell what the number should be for any individual patent. More recently, some, including Lawrence Lessig, have argued that patents in different kinds of industries   such as software patents   should be protected for different lengths of time.

In computer science, a heuristic is a technique
designed to solve a problem that ignores whether the solution can be proven to be correct, but which usually produces a good solution or solves a simpler problem that contains or intersects with the solution of the more complex problem.

Heuristics are intended to gain computational performance or conceptual simplicity, potentially at the cost of accuracy or precision.

 Human-computer interaction .
In human-computer interaction, heuristic evaluation is a usability-testing technique devised by expert usability consultants. In heuristic evaluation, the user interface is reviewed by experts and its compliance to ten usability heuristics (broadly stated characteristics of a good user interface) is assessed, and any violating aspects are recorded.

Gul Zaman is a citizen of Afghanistan, held in extrajudicial detention in the United States Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, in Cuba.
His detainee ID number is 459.

Gul Zaman is the son of Abib Sarajuddin, and the nephew of Khan Zaman.  The three of them, and their neighbor, Mohammad Gul, were captured on January 21 2002.
Gul Zaman, and Abib Sarajuddin, were released.  Mohammad Gul and Khan Zaman were confirmed to have been correctly classified as "enemy combatants.

Combatant Status Review Tribunal.


Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror.  This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct a competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status.

Subsequently the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals.  The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants -- rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant.

Zaman chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.

allegations.

The allegations Gul Zaman faced during his Tribunal were:

The detainee traveled from Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia in 2001.
The detainee utilized counterfeit travel documents for his travel to Saudi Arabia.
The detainee returned to Afghanistan at the time the Northern Alliance recaptured Kabul.
The detainee's family and village members stated an important Taliban member used the detainee's father's guesthouse.
The detainee lives with his father, Haji Sarajudeen.
The detainee's father worked as a recruiter for Pacha Khan.
Pacha Khan, a renegade Pashtun Commander, has been conducting military operations against the Afghan Transitional Administration (ATA) and coalition foces.
The detainee stated he owns one or two Kalashnikov rifles with 30 rounds of ammunition.
The detainee was captured with communications equipment.
The detainee admits seeing this type of equipment in the possession of Taliban members.
Coalition forces were fired upone during the capture of the detainee and three associates.

testimony.

Gul Zaman acknowledged that he had traveled to Saudi Arabia, to work, but that he traveled on a legal passport.  

He returned for personal reasons.  His return had nothing to do with the recapture of Kabul.

He denied that his father had hosted any Taliban leaders.  He pointed out that he was still in Saudi Arabia at the time his father's house was bombed.

He said that Pasha Khan had asked Mohammed Nasim, a tribal elder, to ask his father to go around to local villages to rally support against the Taliban, during the period when the Taliban was falling.  He said his father didn't work directly for Pasha Khan.

He said he had no knowledge of Pasha Khan going renegade.  At the time of his capture Khan was supporting the Americans, and enjoyed their support.  A February 2 2002 New York Times article describes Pasha Khan competing with another local leader for the American's endorsement of authority over the city of Khost.

He acknowledged that his family owned a rifle.  Owning weapons was one of the traditional privileges granted by the former kings of Afghanistan to their isolated border district.

He denied that anyone in their area owned a radio transmitter.  He acknowledged that, during the Taliban regime, he had seen Taliban officials using communications devices.

He denied hearing or seeing any firing on the night he was captured.
witnesses.

Gul Zaman called two witnesses, his uncle Khan Zaman and his neighbor Mohammad Gul.

Khan Zaman's testimony.

Khan Zaman confirmed that Gul Zaman traveled to Saudi Arabia, on a legal Pakistani passport.  
He confirmed that Gul Zaman returned around the time Kabul was recaptured, but that this had
nothing to do with the timing of his return.  He confirmed that he returned for personal and 
family reasons.

Khan Zaman denied that Gul Zaman's father Abib Sarajuddin had ever hosted Jalaluddin.

Khan Zaman confirmed that Sarajuddin had gone around to neighboring villages, trying to rally 
opposition to the Taliban.  He confirmed that Pasha Khan had requested this of a tribal Elder
Nasim.  He stated that, at this time, Pasha Khan was working with the Americans.

Khan Zaman confirmed that they did not have a radio of any kind in their household.
He said his interrogators showed him a picture of a radio of the kind that American
records said was captured in their household.  He said he had never seen this kind
of radio before in his life.

Khan Zaman denied hearing or seeing any weapons fire on the night they were captured.

Khan Zaman confirmed that they owned a rifle, and that the inhabitants of their isolated district had
traditionally been allowed to own a rifle.

In answer to questioning from the Recorder Khan Zaman confirmed that they lived in an area called
Zani Khel.  But he said it was the name of the area of their tribe, not the name of their village.
Their house was midway between two villages, Shamawat and Khojari.

Khan Zaman was asked if he was familiar with the names Wazir Khan Zadran and Zakim Khan.  These two names were mentioned in the February 2 2002 New York Times article.  One was the brother of Pacha Khan.  The other was his rival for US support for authority over Khost.

Khan Zaman was asked if the village elder Nasim had a relationship with Pacha Khan.  He confirmed that they had both been commanders under an anti-Taliban commander named Pir.

Khan Zaman described how Afghans who had been refugees were able to travel legally on Pakistani passports.

Khan Zaman explained he wasn't caught in the attack on the family home because he was in Gardez that day.  He said Gul Zaman was still in Saudi Arabia.  He said their capture came a month and a half to two and half months following the aerial bombardment destroyed their home.  He said at the time of their capture they had been loaned another home.

Mohammad Gul's testimony.

Mohammad Gul confirmed that Gul Zaman arrived back in the village after he did, and he had arrived back after the American air strike against Gul Zaman's father's house.
He confirmed that there were no radio transmitters in the village.
He confirmed that he did not hear any firing on the night they were captured.
He described, in detail, how  an Afghan, could travel legally on a Pakistani passport.

Mohammad Gul described how Afghanistan had gone through decades of warfare, and that many Afghanis, including Gul Zaman and himself, had fled to Pakistan as refugees.  Pakistan had been willing to issue legal passports to Afghan refugees who could establish their identities.

Determined not to have been an Enemy Combatant.

The Washington Post reports that Zaman was one of 38 detainees who was determined not to have been an enemy combatant during his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.
They report that Zaman remains in detention.

Enchanted Rock is an enormous pink granite pluton just west of the Hill Country of central Texas in the United States. It is located in southern Llano County south of the Llano River, approximately 15 mi (24 km) north of Fredericksburg at . It covers approximately 640 acres (3 km²) and rises approximately 425 ft (130 m) above the surrounding terrain to elevation of 1,825 ft (550 m) above sea level. It the second largest such granite monadnock in the United States after Stone Mountain in Georgia. It is currently part of Enchanted Rock State Natural Area in the Texas state park system.  The natural area covers 1,644 acres.

Geology and History.
The prominent granite dome is visible for many miles in the surrounding basin of the Llano Uplift. Its gentle dome gives the appearance of being the edge of a pebble of leviathan proportions extruding from the earth, in the same manner as the larger Ayers Rock (or Uluru) in Australia. The rock is actually part of segmented ridge, the surface expression of a large igneous batholith of middle Precambrian material that intruded into earlier metamorphic schists and gneiss. The intrusive granite of the pluton was exposed by extensive erosion of the surrounding sedimentary rock (which is primarily limestone).

Archaeological evidence indicates human visitation at the rock going back at least 11,000 years. Folklore of local Native American tribes ascribes magical and spiritual powers to the rock (hence the name 'Enchanted Rock'). The first European to visit the area was probably Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca in 1536. The Tonkawa, who inhabited the area in the 16th century, believed that ghost fires flickered at the top of the dome. In particular they heard unexplained creaking and groaning, which geologists attribute to the rock's night-time contraction after being heated by the sun during the day. The name "Enchanted Rock" derives from Spanish and Anglo-Texan interpretations of such legends and related folklore; the name "Crying Rock" has also been given to the formation. 


The rock has been the subject of numerous geological surveys and paintings. It was declared a National Natural Landmark in 1970. The rock was in private hands until 1978, when it was purchased by the Nature Conservancy. The State of Texas acquired it in 1979 and opened it as a park in 1984 after adding facilities. That same year it was also added to the National Register of Historic Places. It is currently one of the most popular destinations for hiking and camping in central Texas. Climbing footpaths to the top of the dome is a popular activity. Technical rock climbing is very popular there as well.

It is the most recently constituted district of  zmir, and has small guest houses and fish restaurants. Its most dramatic feature is the setting, with villages and orchards clinging to the steep rock slopes. There is a bus service in the area, although private vehicles offer more possibilities for exploring. The road is 100 km. (app. 60 miles) from Izmir city center. Since it is very narrow and curvy in some places it takes about 1 h. 45 m. by automobile. But it takes more than 2 hours by bus. The town is very quiet during winter. The winter population is about 2500. The area is famous for its olives, "kefal" (chelon labrosus - fish) and artichoke.

Timothy R. Tebow (born August 14 1987) is an American football quarterback for the Florida Gators. A highly-touted quarterback known for his ability to run and pass, Tebow chose Florida over the University of Alabama, the University of Michigan, the University of Southern California, and LSU. He is from Jacksonville, Florida, and played quarterback for Allen D. Nease Senior High School, where he became a highly touted Division I-A recruit and ranked among the top quarterback prospects in the nation. In his first season with the Gators, Tebow became an integral part of Urban Meyer's offense as backup to starter Chris Leak as well as a key player in certain situations, providing a hard-to-defend "dual threat" as both a runner and a passer. Coach Meyer has described Tebow as the "sparkplug" of the Gator offense, providing a much needed jolt at just the right time during the games. As a true freshman, Tim Tebow's contribution has helped the Gators win college football's 2007 national championship game for the first time since 1996.  

Biography.

All of the Tebow children were homeschooled by their mother who also worked to instill the family s deep religious beliefs along the way.  In 1996, legislation was passed in Florida allowing homeschooled students to compete in local high school sporting events. The law specifies that homeschool students may participate on the team of the local school in the county and school district in which they live.  The Tebows lived in Duval County and Tim played linebacker and tight end for Trinity Christian in Jacksonville for one season, but his dream was to play quarterback.  Trinity did not pass the ball much and Tim didn t want to hand it off every play, so he began to explore his options.  St. Augustine Nease liked to throw the ball and Coach Craig Howard was known for his passing offense so Tim and his mother moved in to an apartment down the street from the Nease High School in St. Johns County.  With the family farm up for sale in Jacksonville, Tim began playing quarterback for St. Augustine Nease High School and his performance soon began to turn some heads which even lead to a minor controversy over him being a homeschooled student. 

As a junior, Tebow s stock continued to rise as he became a high profile, highly recruited major college quarterback prospect.  The 6 3  225lb quarterback continued to impress during his senior season leading the Nease Panthers to a state title, earning All-State honors, was named Florida's Mr. Football and a Parade All-American.  Tebow finished his high school career with 9,810 passing yards, 3,186 rushing yards, 95 passing touchdowns and 62 rushing touchdowns.  He played in the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Game in San Antonio, Texas which features the top 78 senior high school football players in the nation and is shown nationally on NBC television.

Despite having parental and sibling ties to the University of Florida, Tim remained open minded during the recruiting process and became very close to Alabama coach Mike Shula.  But after careful consideration and much deliberation, he decided to play for the team he felt best suited his skills and style of play.  Tebow chose to play for coach Urban Meyer and the Florida Gators, who employ a similar  spread option  offense that he excelled in at Nease High School.

Tebow was considered one of the nation s top recruits and was the subject of an ESPN  Faces in Sports  documentary.  The segment was titled "Tim Tebow: The Chosen One", and focused on Tim s homeschool controversy and missionary work in the Philippines, as well as his exploits on the field of play and the college recruiting process. Tim Tebow was also featured in Sports Illustrated on the  Faces in the Crowd  page.

Career as a Gator.
In Florida's 2006 "Orange and Blue" Spring scrimmage, Tebow completed 15 of 21 pass attempts for 197 yards and one touchdown. After the game, some Gator fans suggested that Tebow could be named the starting quarterback over current starter, Chris Leak. Coach Urban Meyer later stated that despite Tebow's impressive performance, Leak would remain the starting quarterback. 

Prior to the 2006 season, Tebow was listed by Sports Illustrated as college football's future top mobile quarterback.

Tebow made his college debut in a goal line situation against Southern Mississippi, rushing for a touchdown on a designed quarterback scramble.  He led the team in rushing in the next game, against Central Florida, and finished 2006 as the Gators' second-highest season rushing leader.

He made his SEC debut against the Tennessee Volunteers on September 16 2006. His performance included a ten-yard run on his first carry and converting a critical fourth down near the end of the game.

Tebow's biggest game to date came against the LSU Tigers on October 7 2006, where he accounted for all three of the Gators' touchdowns, passing for two and rushing for another. Tebow had a one-yard run on the goal line for his first score, a one-yard "jump pass" to tight end Tate Casey, in which he jumped in the air and double-pumped his arm before releasing the ball, and a 35-yard play-action pass to wide receiver Louis Murphy.

Tebow played a crucial role in the Gators' victory in the 2007 BCS National Championship game against Ohio State. He threw for one touchdown and rushed for another, accumulating 39 rush yards over the span of the game.

Tebow has been named as one of the "Breakout Players of 2007" for college football by Sporting News, and is the likely starter at quarterback for the Florida Gators in the 2007 season.

In mathematics, particularly in algebraic topology Alexander-Spanier cohomology is a cohomology theory arising from differential forms with compact support on a manifold. It is similar to and in some sense dual to de Rham cohomology. It is named for J. W. Alexander and Edwin Henry Spanier (1921-1996).

Given a manifold X, let  be the real vector space of k-forms on X with compact support, and d be the standard exterior derivative. 
Then the Alexander-Spanier cohomology groups  are the homology of the chain complex :

;

i.e.,  is the vector space of closed k-forms modulo that of exact k-forms.

Despite their definition as the homology of an ascending complex, the Alexander-Spanier groups demonstrate covariant behavior; for example, given the inclusion mapping for an open set U of X, extension of forms on U to X (by defining them to be 0 on X-U) is a map  inducing a map 

.

They also demonstrate contravariant behavior with respect to proper maps - that is, maps such that the inverse image of every compact set is compact. Let f: U   X be such a map; then the pullback



induces a map

.

A Mayer-Vietoris sequence holds for Alexander-Spanier cohomology.

<doc id="1144404" title="Taft-Katsura Agreement" nonfiltered="145" processed="143" dbindex="1480145">
The  was a secret diplomatic memorandum signed between United States Secretary of War William Howard Taft and Prime Minister of Japan Katsura Taro on 29 July 1905. In the agreement, the United States recognized Japan's sphere of influence in Korea; in exchange, Japan recognized the United States's sphere of influence in the Philippines. The agreement was not publicized until 1924, and was not a bilaterally signed document or secret treaty, but only a meeting memorandum meant to smooth over Japanese-American relations.

Details.
The Taft-Katsura Memorandum (also commonly called the Taft-Katsura Agreement) consists of the meeting notes containing portions of a long, confidential conversation between Japanese Prime Minister Katsura and US Secretary of War Taft held in Tokyo on the morning of 27 July 1905. The memorandum detailing these discussions was dated 29 July 1905. 

Three significant issues were discussed during the meeting: 

First were Katsura's views on peace in east Asia which according to him formed the fundamental principle of Japan's foreign policy and was best accomplished by a good understanding between Japan, the United States and Great Britain.

The second issue concerned the Philippines. On this, Taft observed that it was in Japan's best interests to have the Philippines governed by a strong and friendly nation like the United States; Katsura confirmed in the strongest terms that Japan had no aggressive designs on the Philippines. 

Finally, regarding Korea, Katsura observed that Korea was a matter of absolute importance to Japan, as Korea was the direct cause of the just concluded Russo-Japanese War. Katsura stated that a comprehensive solution of the Korea problem would be the war's logical outcome. Katsura further stated that if left alone, Korea would continue to improvidently enter into agreements/treaties with other powers which created the original problem. Therefore, Japan must take steps to prevent Korea from again creating conditions which would force Japan into fighting another foreign war. 

For his part, Secretary Taft concurred that the establishment of a Japanese protectorate over Korea would directly contribute to stability in east Asia. Taft also presented his belief that President Roosevelt would concur in his views in this regard.

This proviso clearly aimed at Imperial China, which until the Chinese-Japanese war of 1894/95 had Korea under his umbrella. With Russia beaten in the 1904/05 war and the US practicing benign neglect in the aftermath, the door was open for Japan to take control of Korea. Thus the Taft Katsura Agreement was at the beginning of Japanese colonial rule in Korea until Japan's defeat in WW II in 1945.

Korean reaction. 
Many Korean historians believe that the Taft-Katsura Agreement violated the  Korean-American Treaty of Amity and Commerce" signed at Incheon on 22 May 1882. The Joseon Government considered that treaty constituted a defacto mutual defense treaty while the Americans did not. As the Agreement paved the way for recognition of Japanese interests in Korea as later stated in the Treaty of Portsmouth, it can also be considered on of the direct causes of Korean colonization by Japan. Even today, while the Taft-Katsura Agreement is all but an obscure footnote in history, the Agreement is raised, in the present day (2006), by Korean activists in the media as an example of how the United States cannot be trusted with regards to Korean security and sovereignty issues.

Father James Edmund Groppi (November 16, 1930   November 4,1985) was a Roman Catholic priest and noted civil rights activist.

Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Italian immigrant parents, Groppi was ordained to the Roman Catholic priesthood in June of 1959, after studying at Mount Calvary Seminary (1950-1952) and St. Francis Seminary (1952-1959).

At first assigned to St. Veronica's Church in Milwaukee, in 1963 Groppi was transferred to St. Boniface, the latter parish having a predominantly African-American congregation.  It was then that Groppi became interested in - and active in - the cause of civil rights for black Americans, participating in the 1963 March on Washington and also the Selma to Montgomery marches in 1965 on behalf of the Voting Rights Act.  

Later in 1965, he returned to Milwaukee, where he began organizing protests against the segregation of Milwaukee public schools. Later he lead fair housing marches across the 16th Street Viaduct (since renamed in his honor) spanning the Menomonee River Valley. The 1/2 mile wide valley was considered to be a symbolic divide for the city.

In 1967, Groppi discovered that several judges in the Milwaukee area belonged to the Fraternal Order of Eagles, which at the time did not admit non-whites to its membership.  Groppi questioned how a judge who was a member of an organization that did not welcome African-Americans as members could rule impartially in cases involving African-Americans, and reacted by organizing pickets at the homes of some of the judges, most notably Circuit Court Judge Robert Cannon, despite the fact that Cannon was a liberal and had voiced opposition to the Eagles' membership policies.  These demonstrations continued, on and off, until 1969.  Also during this period, Groppi worked for passage of legislation which would outlaw discrimination in the buying and renting of homes (in 1968 such a law was passed on the federal level, known as the Fair Housing Act).

Groppi's ecclesiastical superiors did not always approve of his activities, and in 1970 transferred him to St. Michael's Church.  He then gradually became disenchanted with the priesthood, leaving it in 1976 to get married, eventually having a child as well.  In 1979 he became a bus driver for the Milwaukee Transit System - a job he had previously held in the 1950s to help put himself through the seminary and remained in that capacity until his death in 1985. He is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Milwaukee. His papers are at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee.

<doc id="19630" title="Man" nonfiltered="149" processed="147" dbindex="1480149">


A man is a male human.  The term man (irregular plural: men) is usually used for an adult, with the term boy being the usual term for a male child or adolescent (sometimes also applied to  childish adult men). However, the term is also used for a human regardless of age or sex, sometimes even extended to more primitive humanoids than the present species Homo sapiens, as in apeman.

Etymology.
The English term "Man" (from Proto-Germanic mannaz "man, person") and words derived therefrom can designate any or even all of the human race regardless of their gender or age. This is indeed the oldest usage of "Man" in English. This derives from a Proto-Indo-European root *man-" meaning hand. A similar cognate is Old Norse "mund", hand. The distinctive and dexterous hands of humans, compared to those of other animals, are the basis of this term and the similarly derived term, "manual" (from Latin "Manus", hand), by hand.

Age and terminology.
Manhood is the period in a male's life after he has transitioned from boyhood, at least physically, during puberty. Many cultures have rites of passage to symbolize a man's coming of age, such as confirmation in some branches of Christianity, bar mitzvah in Judaism, or even just the celebration of the eighteenth or twenty-first birthday, as in most Western societies.

A  boy is a male human child. For many, the word man implies a certain degree of maturity and responsibility that young men in particular often feel unprepared for; yet they may also feel too old to be called a boy. For this reason, many avoid using either man or boy to describe a young man and prefer colloquial terms such as bloke, lad, chap, fellow, guy or dude.

 Biology and gender . 


Humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability, however most of these characteristic do have a role in sexual attraction. Most expressions of sexual dimorphism in humans are found in height, weight, and body structure, though there are always examples that do not follow the overall pattern. For example, men tend to be taller than women, but there are many people of both sexes who are in the mid-height range for the species. 

Some examples of male secondary sexual characteristics in humans, those acquired as boys become men or even later in life, are:
 deeper voice;
 taller height;
 facial hair or beard;
 growth of pubic hair and hair under arms and on chest;
 increased body size overall;
 less subcutaneous fat;
 increase in overall body hair;
 coarser skin;
 darker skin tone;
 penis grows larger;
 testicles grow larger and lower;
 A higher level of androgenic hormones such as testosterone, leading to increased muscle mass ;

The sex organs of a man are part of the reproductive system, consisting of the penis, testicles, vas deferens, and the prostate gland. The male reproductive system's function is to produce semen which carries sperm and thus genetic information that can unite with an egg within a woman. Since sperm that enters a woman's uterus and then fallopian tubes goes on to fertilize an egg which develops into a fetus or child, the male reproductive system plays no necessary role during the gestation. The concept of fatherhood and family exists in human societies. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology. Most, but not all, men have the karyotype 46/XY.

In general, men suffer from many of the same illnesses as women. However, there are some sex-related illnesses that occur only, or more frequently, in men. For example, autism and color blindness are more common in men than women. As well, some age-related disorders such as Alzheimer's disease appear to be more common among men, though whether this is due to a genuinely higher incidence or because men have lower life expectancies than women is uncertain.

Twenty percent of males, particularly in the U.S., the Philippines, and South Korea, as well as Jews and Muslims from all countries, have experienced circumcision, a process of altering the penis from its natural state by removing the foreskin.

Biological factors are not always sufficient determinants of whether a person considers themselves a man or is considered a man. Intersexed men may have physical features that are more common in women. In addition female-to-male transgender or transsexual individuals are often considered men psychologically as well as in the social and legal senses (varying by district and culture) but are born with physiology that would be considered typicaly female.

Sexual characteristics.
In humans, the sex of an individual is generally determined at the time of fertilization by the genetic material carried in the sperm cell. If a sperm cell carrying an X chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be female (XX); if a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the egg, the offspring will typically be male (XY).  This is refered to as the XY sex-determination system and is typical of most mammals, but quite a few other sex-determination systems exist, including some that are non-genetic.  The term primary sexual characteristics denotes the kind of gamete the gonad produces: The ovary produces egg cells in the female, and the testis produces sperm cells in the male. The term secondary sexual characteristics denotes all other sexual distinctions that play indirect roles in uniting sperm and eggs. Secondary sexual characteristics include everything from the specialized male and female features of the genital tract, to the brilliant plumage of male birds or facial hair of humans, to behavioral features such as courtship.

Generally, the more highly evolved the species, the more elaborate are its secondary sexual characteristics. At the time the eggs of starfish ripen, the male merely releases great quantities of sperm cells into the ocean water, and a tiny but sufficient number of them find and penetrate distant eggs. Frogs and toads are drawn to mates by calls, and they spawn in water; the male makes cloacal contact with the female and releases sperm externally, simultaneously with the eggs. Terrestrial animals, especially mammals, which do not have an environment of water through which sperm can propel itself, rely on herding and flocking, courtship, competition among males, and more specialized genitalia including an erectile penis.

Sex hormones.
In mammals, the hormones that influence sexual differentiation and development are androgens (mainly testosterone), which stimulate later development of the ovary. In the sexually undifferentiated embryo, testosterone stimulates the development of the Wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum.  Another significant hormone in sexual differeniation is the Anti-muellarian hormone, which inhibits development of the Müllerian ducts.

For males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis, along with the full sexual distinction of a human male from a human female, while women are acted upon by estrogens and progesterones to produce their sexual distinction from the human male.

 Gender stereotypes .

Enormous debate in Western societies has focused on perceived social, intellectual, or emotional differences between men and women. These differences are very difficult to quantify for both scientific and political reasons. Below are a few stereotypical claims sometimes made about men in relation to women:

 More aggressive than women. However, in interpersonal relationships, most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive. Men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home.
 More courageous and adventuresome than women.
 More competitive but also more stubborn than women.
 More self-confident (even proud) and exhibit better leadership skills than women.
 More self-controlled and less emotional.
 More spacially intelligent than than women, but less empathetic.
 More prone to abstract thinking than women.

Some of these differences have been supported by scientific research; others have not. For example, in interpersonal relationships, most research has found that men and women are equally aggressive. Men do tend to be more aggressive outside of the home. It is especially difficult and contentious for science to separate the "innate" or biological differences from the learned or social differences. All should be considered broad generalizations; that is, at least a large minority of either gender would fit better with the other gender in any one of these aspects.

A number of the above stereotypes were not perceived in the same way as today (i.e., their applications to particular aspects and spheres of life, such as work vs. home) until the 19th century, beginning with industrialization.

In terms of outward appearance, few men in Western cultures wear cosmetics or clothing generally associated with female gender roles. (Doing so is generally stigmatized and viewed as cross-dressing.)

It is claimed men on average have a higher IQ than women of around five points.

Culture and gender roles.


Well into prehistoric culture, men are believed to have assumed a variety of social and cultural roles which are likely similar across many groups of humans. In hunter-gatherer societies, men were often if not exclusively responsible for all large game killed, the capture and raising of most or all domesticated animals, the building of permanent shelters, the defense of villages, and other tasks where the male physique and strong spatial-cognition were most useful. Some anthropologists believe that it may have been men who led the Neolithic Revolution and became the first pre-historical ranchers, as a possible result of their intimate knowledge of animal life.

Throughout history, the roles of men have changed greatly. As societies have moved away from agriculture as a primary source of jobs, the emphasis on male physical ability has waned. Traditional gender roles for middle-class men typically involved jobs emphasizing moderate to hard manual labor (see Blue-collar worker), often with no hope for increase in wage or position. For poorer men among the working classes the need to support their families, especially during periods of industrial change and economic decline, forced them to stay in dangerous jobs working long arduous hours, often without retirement. Many industrialized countries have seen a shift to jobs which are less physically demanding, with a general reduction in the percentage of manual labor needed in the work force (see White-collar worker). The male goal in these circumstances is often of pursuing a quality education and securing a dependable, often office-environment, source of income. 

The Men's Movement is in part a struggle for the recognition of equality of opportunity with women, and for equal rights irrespective of gender, even if special relations and conditions are willingly incurred under the form of partnership involved in marriage. The difficulties of obtaining this recognition are due to the habits and customs recent history has produced. Through a combination of economic changes and the efforts of the feminist movement in recent decades, men in some societies now face women who receive educational and workplace benefit based solely on gender. Modern men in Western society still face challenges in the workplace as well as on the topics of education, violence, health care, politics, and fatherhood - to name a few. Research has identified anti-male sexism, and the effects of its expansion may increase hardships for many males.

Charlie Strong (born August 2, 1960 in Batesville, Arkansas), is a college football coach currently serving as co-defensive coordinator, assistant head coach, and linebacker position coach of the Florida Gators.

After lettering for four years (1980-83) at University of Central Arkansas, Strong joined the Gator coaching staff after college as a graduate assistant in 1983.  His first full-time coaching job was at Southern Illinois in 1986, where he coached wide receivers.  He later assumed defensive coaching duties at Florida and Notre Dame.

In 1999 Strong joined the South Carolina Gamecocks as defensive coordinator, becoming the first African-American coordinator in Southeastern Conference history.  His stifling defenses and well-mannered personality created buzz that he would be possibly the first black head coach in the SEC, but job offers were slim (Sylvester Croom eventually broke the color barrier in the SEC coaching ranks).

Strong was hired as defensive coordinator for the Gators before the 2003 season.  When head coach Ron Zook took the University of Illinois coaching job with one game left in the 2004 season, Strong served as interim coach of the Gators for one game, the 2004 Peach Bowl, technically making him the second black head coach in SEC history.  Florida lost the game, 27-10, to the Miami Hurricanes.

Taxus sumatrana is an evergreen shrub and one of the eight species of the yew. It is found in a number of countries, including Afghanistan, Tibet, Nepal, Vietnam, India, Burma and China, and is known as the Chinese yew. It is typically found at heights ranging from 400-3100m in subtropical forest and on  highland ridges.  It can also be found conserved in the Taroko National Park in Taiwan and the Ayubia National Park in Pakistan.

Appearance.

The Taxus sumatrana is a wide trunked, bushy tree that grows to an average height of 14m. It's leaves are 1.2-2.7 cm long and 2-2.5 mm wide, and grow in two ranks along the branches, abruptly spiralling into an apex at the tip, with a pale yellow-green colour on top, and light green underneath. The Chinese yew has fleshy seeds that ripen into a red colour, and a grey-red bark which exfoliates in irregular 1.5 mm thick flakes and leaves scars on the trunk that appear yellow quickly after cutting.

Uses.

The oil used to mark a red spot on the forehead of a Brahmin is made by mixing oil with the bark from this tree. Chinese yews are also used for clogs, whip handles, bed frames and bows.

<doc id="3212105" title="Coastwatchers" nonfiltered="153" processed="151" dbindex="1480153">
 The Coastwatchers, also known as the Coast Watch Organisation, Combined Field Intelligence Service or Section "C" Allied Intelligence Bureau, were Allied military intelligence operatives stationed on remote Pacific island locations during World War II, to observe enemy movements and rescue stranded Allied personnel. They played a significant role in the Pacific Ocean theatre and South West Pacific theatre particularly as an early warning network for during the Battle of Guadalcanal. There were about 400 Coastwatchers in all   they were mostly Australian military officers, Pacific Islanders and escaped Allied prisoners of war.  The Coastwatchers were led by Lieutenant Commander Eric Feldt, who was based in Townsville, Australia. Their actions were particularly important in montioring Japanese activity in the roughly thousand islands that make up the Solomon Islands.

Many personnel who took part in Coastwatcher operations behind enemy lines were commissioned as officers of the Royal Australian Navy Volunteer Reserve (RANVR), to protect them in case of capture, although this was not always recognized by the Japanese military, which executed several.  The Coastwatchers' numbers were also augmented by escaped Allied personnel and even civilians. In one strange case, three German missionaries assisted the coastwatchers after escaping Japanese captivity. (Germany was an ally of Japan).

Feldt chose "Ferdinand" as the code name for his organisation, from a popular children's book about a bull, The Story of Ferdinand. He explained this by saying:

Ferdinand ... did not fight but sat under a tree and just smelled the flowers. It was meant as a reminder to Coastwatchers that it was not their duty to fight and so draw attention to themselves, but to sit circumspectly and unobtrusively, gathering information. Of course, like their titular prototype, they could fight if they were stung.;

In June 1942, "Ferdinand" became  part of the Allied Intelligence Bureau, which was under the South West Pacific Area (command) (SWPA). However Feldt reported to both GHQ, SWPA, in Brisbane and the Fleet Radio Unit in Melbourne (FRUMEL), which was under the Pacific Ocean Areas (command).

In 1942, two coastwatchers on Bougainville, Read and Mason, radioed early warning of Japanese warship and air movement (citing the numbers, type and speed of enemy units) to the United States Navy. Coastwatcher reports allowed U.S. forces to launch aircraft in time to engage the attackers. Admiral William Halsey, Jr. was later to say that the two men had saved Guadalcanal.

One of the most highly decorated coastwatchers was Sergeant Major Jacob C. Vouza who retired from the local constabulary in 1941, volunteered for coastwatcher duty, but was subsequently captured, tortured, then bayoneted and left to die. He survived and escaped to make contact with Marines warning them of an impending Japanese attack. He recovered from his wounds and continued to scout for the Marines. He was awarded the Silver Star and Legion of Merit by the United States and later received a knighthood as a Member of the British Empire.

In August 1943, LTJG John F. Kennedy of the United States Navy   a future President of the United States   and twelve fellow crew memebers were shipwrecked after the sinking of their boat, the PT-109. An Australian coastwatcher, Sub-Lt Arthur Reginald Evans, observed the explosion of the US Navy PT-109 when it was rammed by a Japanese destroyer. Despite US Navy crews giving up the crew as a complete loss, Evans dispatched two Solomon Islander scouts including Biuki Gasa in dugout canoes who found Kennedy and his surviving crew, who delivered a message inscribed on a coconut. Kennedy had scratched a message to Evans on the coconut describing the plight and position of his crew. The future U.S. President was rescued shortly after, and 20 years later welcomed Evans to the White House. Gasa did not make the trip for reasons that are unclear. 

Coastwatchers in popular culture.
Evans was depicted in the PT 109 and named in the Jimmy Dean hit song, also called "PT-109". In the 1964 film Father Goose, actor Cary Grant plays a coastwatcher. In the musical South Pacific, a US Marine is sent to do a similar job.

In W. E. B. Griffin's The Corps series, Griffin gives credit to Australian coastwatchers for their services at Guadalcanal.

Kirkdale TMD (code KK) is a Traction Maintenance Depot located beside Kirkdale railway station in north Liverpool, England. It is the largest depot on the Merseyrail network, located on the Northern Line and is used primarily for stabling units, carrying out minor repair works and cleaning units both outside and in.

History.
Originally known as Bank Hall sidings, the depot area was originally a large area of sidings with more than 30 roads. In the 1970s, when the new Link tunnel was being built to replace Liverpool Exchange, the sidings were transformed into a modern maintenance depot. A new shed with four roads was constructed, with wells underneath the tracks so that units could be inspected; each road is long enough to house two 3-car sets coupled together. Also constructed was a new carriage wash plant so that units could be driven through and cleaned within minutes; presently this is the only active washing plant on Merseyrail, the other at Birkenhead North TMD having been destroyed by consistent vandalism. With the depot's proximity to Kirkdale station, it was renamed upon the reopening.

Recent.
In 2006, a new wheel lathe is being constructed at the depot in an area formerly used for storage of departmental equipment. The new lathe will end the previous act of having train sets towed to Allerton TMD near Hunts Cross railway station by an 08 Shunter.

Allocation.
The Class 507 and Class 508 electric multiple units are based at Kirkdale depot, regularly stabled in the back sidings near Bank Hall railway station. In 2006, a new small shunter will be allocated to the depot to take sets into the new wheel lathe.

Previously, battery locomotives and Class 73 locos have been stored at the depot in the past for sandite duties in the winter.

 Disco Junkies .



The underground cartoon Disco Junkies was written and illustrated by Alex Fryer, and first appeared as a free black and white comic in the summer of 2005, distributed through the Internet and live music scene of Guildford. It initially took the form of graffiti style stickers and flyers, largely consisting of single illustrations and one pannel jokes. 

Several bars and clubs in the city, having commissioned illustrations, helped to popularise Alex's style of illustration, which carried the 'Disco Junkie' tag. Several indy bands used 'Disco Junkie' artwork in their flyers, the most notable being 'The Fake' and 'Jack Rabbit Agenda'. The 'Disco Junkie' label received indirect criticism from the Surrey Advertiser, after a sticker and flyer campaign involving artwork designed to look like parking tickets and currency, fell foul of a local councellor. Not long after this, Disco Junkies returned to being purely a comic, rather than a brand of localised flyer design.



Since the comics sketchy beginings, the stories were further developed, and a series of new characters added. While loosely based around The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the comic contained many drugs references, topical story lines, and borrowed themes from several schools of fantasy, science fiction and comedy. Many of the characters were anthropomorphic, and caracatured people in the media and politics.

Alex Fryer, was, at the time a Video Production student in Guildford. Though the future of the comic was never certain, several short illustration anthologies were printed in black and white and artwork still appears around the city from time to time.

Alex Fryer is also credited as an editor for this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4dsmwzIEE

<doc id="1009988" title="Hi and Lois" nonfiltered="158" processed="156" dbindex="1480158">

Hi and Lois is a comic strip about a suburban family.  It debuted on October 18, 1954 and is distributed by King Features. 

Hiram ("Hi") and Lois Flagston are typical American suburbanites. They have four children: a stereotypically slovenly teen named Chip, rambunctious twins named Dot and Ditto, and a baby named Trixie, who loves talking to "sunbeam," a ray of sunlight.  They also have a large shaggy dog named Dawg. Their neighbors are the Thurstons, the fat and lazy "Thirsty" and his skinny wife Irma.

The Flagstons first appeared in Mort Walker's strip Beetle Bailey.  They spun off into their own strip, written by Walker and drawn by Dik Browne. Lois Flagston (née Bailey) is Beetle Bailey's sister, and the two strips make occasional crossovers. One of these occurred on the strip's 40th anniversary in 1994, when Beetle visited his sister Lois and her family.   

Today many consider Hi and Lois to be rather dated. The strip made efforts to keep up with the times, such as housewife Lois Flagston taking up a career in real estate in 1980. In previous decades the strip was acclaimed; in 1962 it earned Dik Browne a Reuben Award from the National Cartoonists Society.

The strip faced some controversy given the changes in morals since its debut in the 1950s. Once, editors insisted that belly buttons could not appear; in protest, Browne included a box of dimpled navel oranges.

The strip is now written by Brian and Greg Walker and drawn by Robert "Chance" Browne, the sons of the original creative team.

Hans Achim Litten (June 19, 1903   February 5, 1938) was a young lawyer, born in Halle, who had represented anti-Nazis at nearly all the important political trials after 1929. 

In May, 1931 he had even subjected Adolf Hitler to a two-hour cross examination in a case concerning two workers stabbed by stormtroopers. He was not forgotten, and, on the night of the Reichstag fire he was aroused from his bed, arrested, and sent without trial to Spandau Prison. From there he was moved, despite efforts by his mother to free him, to Sonnenberg concentration camp. From Sonnenberg he passed to the notorious Sachsenhausen, where his treatment was later described by an eyewitness to his mother.

He survived this ordeal only to be sent to the Dachau concentration camp, where he was reported to have hanged himself. His mother Irmgard Litten wrote a book about his ordeal titled in English, "Beyond Tears."

When East and West Germany were reunited, the lawyers association of Berlin chose to call itself the Hans Litten Bar Association. Every two years a lawyer is given the Hans Litten Prize by the German and European Democratic Lawyers Association. The Israeli lawyer Leah Tsemel and the American lawyer Michael Ratner, President of the Center for Constitutional Rights, have both received the Litten prize.

<doc id="3522545" title="Nana (rapper)" nonfiltered="162" processed="160" dbindex="1480162">

Nana Kwame Abrokwa
(born in 5 October 1968 in Accra, Ghana) is a German rapper and DJ, performing under the pseudonyms Nana or Darkman / Nana. Nana is not an actual first name, but a Ghanese title of nobility. His most important achievement came in the second half of the 1990's, when his style was characterized as "euro-rap" and his lyrics focused on the relationship with God, with his family, or on topics like racism and Holocaust.

 Biography .

Nana arrived in Hamburg with his mother and his brothers at the age of 10. At the beginning of the 90's, his debut consists of DJ-ing in hip-hop clubs. he also co-produces and raps in some songs of DJ David Fascher ("Here We Go", "Make The Crowd Go Wild"), under the alias MC Africa True.

In 1995 he joins as a rapper the Eurodance project Darkness, which was produced by Bülent Aris and Toni Cottura. The song "In My Dreams" becomes a club hit, but Nana didn't feel very comfortable with the style Darkness adopted and the group separates. However, his current scene name, Darkman, originates from this time.

In 1996 Aris and Cottura founded the Black Music label Booya Music, which Nana joined as the first artist. The first single, "Darkman" reached the German Top 10. The following one, "Lonely", became the most successful euro-rap song, being No. 1 for several weeks. The album, Nana, released in 1997, is more on the mainstream, US style of rapping. It features numerous other members of the Booya Family, such as Jan van der Toorn and Alex Prince.

The second album, Father, was released in May 1998 and contains rather slow pieces with very personal lyrics. The songs "Too Much Heaven" and "War" were also featured on the tribute albums Love The Bee Gees and Hands on Motown.

At the end of 1999, Nana's released the single "I Wanna Fly", which flopped, due to a decrease in euro-rap's popularity and the growing importance of hip-hop played in German. Nevertheless Nana still recorded two further albums with Booya Music, which were not released due to legal problems.

At the beginning of 2001 Nana released the German-language song Du wirst sehen, a gesture which was not appreciated by international fans. The single flopped, and the planned bilingual album Global Playa was canceled at the request of the record company.

After a long break, in the summer of 2004, Nana finally released the album All Doors In Flight No. 7, featuring Jan van der Toorn and Manuell, on his own label, Darkman Records. The album was distributed exclusively over the Internet, through Nana's website.

As of 2005, Nana is purportedly featured on a tape compilation of an underground DJ, Essenz Finezt (see Euro-rap.com).

<doc id="7860324" title="List of The Land Before Time characters" nonfiltered="163" processed="161" dbindex="1480163">
This article is about characters in the fictional Land Before Time universe.

Main Characters.
Littlefoot.

Littlefoot is an Apatosaurus but is called a longneck in the films. He is the central character of the film The Land Before Time and its sequels.

He is close friends to five other baby prehistoric animals (Cera, Ducky, Spike, Petrie, and Chomper). Littlefoot's having friends outside his species is a taboo, as many of the dinosaurs practice racial, or species based, segregation. His grandparents accept his friendships but other dinosaurs, such as Topsy (Cera's father), do not.

Littlefoot's primary caregiver is his grandparents, as his mother was killed in the original film, and his father, Bron, was separated from him and his mother shortly before Littlefoot's birth. Littlefoot later found his father in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration and met his foster brother, Shorty. Bron offered to let Littlefoot stay with him, but Littlefoot declined, staying with his friends and grandparents in the Great Valley.

Cera.

Cera is a Triceratops and a friend of Littlefoot.

Cera is a bossy dinosaur who tries to show no fear. She has no problem bragging about her accomplishments, but will run away at the first sign of any real danger. She is very sweet and caring, but that side of her personality is usually masked by her normally gruff exterior.

Cera's father Topsy, is seen in every film in the series, except The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, but her mother was only seen in background shots of the original The Land Before Time. In The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, Cera's dad was in love with his new girlfriend, Tria and had his name revealed. Cera has a brother and sister, who were seen briefly in The Land Before Time, and has a nephew and a niece, Dana and Dinah. Strangly, these two dino-toddlers have tiny bony stubs on there foreheads wich are clearly small horns. Cera, however, even though she is older then them, has yet to acquire horns on her head. Dinah and Dana made their appearances and were seen in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock.

In The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, her design was slightly modified to make her look older and more appealing. Her head and face is now less round and more angular, but her body design remains true to the original film.

Ducky.

Ducky is a Saurolophus, which is also called a "big mouth" or a "swimmer". She tends to say "Yep yep yep" quite a lot, which is frequently quoted today in popular culture and everyday life. Ducky's personality compared to the others is very caring and, at times, somewhat childish. Although she is sensitive to others' feelings, she can be easily manipulated to believe that some things may be right when in fact they might lead to trouble. This is shown in the first The Land Before Time movie when Cera convinced her that a certain route to the Great Valley was easier than the way up a mountain of loose rocks. This in fact lead to danger, as she and Spike ended up lost.

Petrie.

Petrie is a pterosaur, and is also called a flyer, (a Pteranodon to be exact).

Petrie has a family, which are a mom (voiced by Tress MacNeille) and a bunch of brothers and sisters. He was originally afraid of flying until a tangle with the Original Sharptooth gave him the courage (and breath) to save his friends. He used to idolize his Uncle Pterano, thinking he can do no wrong. Later he finds out that Pterano is as insecure as Petrie is. It is ironic how alike Pterano and Petrie are, not just in looks, but in personality. He seems to have a strong friendship with Ducky.

Spike.

Spike is, as his name implies, a 'spike-tail' (Stegosaurus).

He is one of the youngest members of the group, Chomper being the only major character younger than him. In fact, Littlefoot, Ducky, and Petrie witnessed his hatching and Ducky's mother adopted him upon reaching the Great Valley, as his family has yet to be seen. A Stegosaur family did, however, offer to take him with them, although he decided to stay with Ducky and his family. 

He is known for his large appetite and can often be seen chasing after some piece of food (a bush, leaves, exc.). He is also portrayed as mute, although later films, like The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire or The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, show that he can speak perfectly well. He simply chooses not too.

Chomper.

Chomper is a Tyrannosaurus, which is known as a sharptooth in the Land Before Time movies. He is bilingual, being able to speak both the herbivore language of Littlefoot and his friends (heard as English to the viewer), and the "Sharptooth" language of Tyrannosaurus, which seems to consist of grunts, roars, and clicks. Littlefoot and his friends originally found Chomper as an egg and took care of him as surrogate parents until he was found by his real parents. He left the Great Valley with them and was not seen again until The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, where he was living on an island with his parents. Now that the landbridge which connected the island to the mainland has been destroyed, he and his parents cannot get off the island. However, in the tv series, which appears to be after Land Before Time XI, he is shown still in the Great Valley, but without his parents.

Chomper is portrayed by Rob Paulsen in The Land Before Time II, Cannon Young in The Land Before Time V, and Max Burkholder in the TV series.

Ruby.

Ruby is a new friend of Littlefoot and his friends and appears in the television series. She is a female Oviraptor.

Parents, Foster Parents, Relatives and Adoptees.
Bron.
Bron is Littlefoot's father. He was separated from Littlefoot, his mother, and Grandpa and Grandma Longneck shortly before Littlefoot's birth. Until The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, Bron was unsure of his wife and son's fates. Bron also has an adopted son named Shorty.

In Part X, Littlefoot and his grandparents get a sudden urge to migrate to an unknown place, and when they arrive, they find hundreds of other longnecks. One of them was Bron, who recognizes Grandpa Longneck, and Littlefoot meets his father for the first time. Littlefoot didn't take this very well, however. He thought Bron had abandoned him and his mother, and he retreated into seclusion.  Bron caught up with him, and explains how they had gotten separated. Littlefoot accepts this and the two bond, much to the displeasure of Shorty, Littlefoot's foster brother. Shorty and Littlefoot made amends, however, when they were forced to work together to save themselves from attacking sharpteeth.it is unkown if Ali's Mother is his or his wife's sister.

Cera's Brothers and Sisters.
Chomper's Parents.
They only appeared in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure and The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island. They are both green in color, but the mother and father are distinguished by exact shade, with the father being much darker (this may reflect a gender or racial difference). Although they are ferocious predators like the other sharpteeth, they are also devoted parents. It is suggested in the series that they hired Ruby as some sort of babysitter for Chomper. Both Ruby and Chomper were separated from their family by Redclaw and his minions, and so far they have yet to reunite.

Dinah and Dana.
Dinah and Dana are little Triceratops twins. They are Cera's niece and nephew. They first appeared in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock and have not been seen since the further sequels.

Ducky and Spike's father.
he is rarly seen but has apeared when at the nest or in the back ground like in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze.but he still lives.

Ducky and Spike's Mother.
Ducky and Spike's mother is a Saurolophus and has appeared in most of the 11 movies that have debuted so far. More than Littlefoot's mother was, she is blind to race as seen in her inter-racial/species adoption of Spike, a Stegosaurus. She loves all her children (Ducky and Spike have other nestmates) and is very attentive. She is popular among Littlefoot and his friends for these reasons and is treated with respect both by Littlefoot and his friends as well as the adults in the Great Valley. She occasionally has doubts on how to raise Spike, whether in keeping with her own values or with spike-tail customs. This was seen in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze when a Stegosaur herd met and befriended Spike. She even let him go with the herd to learn "his kind's" ways; however when Spike fell through ice it was she who rescued her grateful son.

This is also scientifically accurate as at least some Hadrosaurids such as Maiasaura, or "good mother lizard," are believed to have been attentive parents. Curiously, her son is shown as being able to walk and even talk soon after hatching unlike other young dinosaurs in the film while the evidence for hadrosaur parental care rests in the fact that young were unable to care for themselves.

Ducky and Spike's Brothers and Sisters.
ther are at least 14 of ther brothers and sisters.

Grandpa and Grandma Longneck.
Grandpa and Grandma Longneck are Littlefoot's grandparents and his primary caregivers after his mother died. They act as parents to Littlefoot, giving him advice when needed and take their responsibility of protecting Littlefoot very seriously. (When, in Part VI, Littlefoot called Doc the greatest, his grandfather was visibly hurt.) Their real names have yet to be revealed, as most everyone calls them Grandpa and Grandma. Topsy calls Littlefoot's grandfather "Longneck" and Bron, Littlefoot's father, calls him "Poppa Longneck."

They also provide a voice of reason in the Great Valley, trying to make peace between the dinosaurs when times become hard. Detailed analysis of the film series shows that Littlefoot's grandfather has assumed a leadership position among the dinosaurs of the Valley, welcoming visitors and newcomers (The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists and The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock), passing judgement on criminals (The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire), deciding a course of action for the herds of the Valley (The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island) managing natural resources such as water (The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island), and providing for the common defense in times of danger (The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure).

Grandpa Longneck is also shown to be a very loving husband to his wife (a song from part IV indicates that marriage does exist in the Land Before Time universe) and a kindly grandfather-figure not only to Littlefoot but to all the young dinosaurs of the Valley. He in fact, has been known to tell children stories around the campfire--or lavapool. It can also be assumed that he was good father to his late daughter, Littlefoot's mother. He also gets along well with Bron his son-in-law. However, while is mostly free of the bigotry that characterizes some other dinosaurs, he has a prejudiced view of sharptooth dinosaurs. He sees them as "not very bright"; however, with how one killed his daughter, it is a a less severe condemnation than that of his son-in-law who despises them as cowards.

As seen in Part V, after being separated from Littlefoot, his grandparents gave up hope of ever seeing either him of their daughter again and went searching for the Valley. On the way, they met other dinosaurs who joined their search for the Valley as well, not unlike how their children also found and joined each other. It is likely at this time that he was formally introduced to Topsy and assumed the leadership of the combined herds. As of the moment, Grandpa and Grandma Longneck live happily in the Great Valley, though they occasionally meet with relatives as in the Part IV or leave to meet with other longnecks as in Part X.

Grandpa Longneck has been shown to be rather undecided in his beliefs. (This is quite unlike his daughter who stated that "somethings  you see with your heart" and whose ghost in the first films shows that the supernatural does indeed exist.) In The Secret of Saurus Rock he tells the children legends of heroic dinosaurs and of the mystical Saurus Rock that protects the Valley but when asked which of the stories are really true, he doesn't know. However, during The Great Longneck Migration he just knows that he must go and that he must re-enact the longneck creation myth.

Grandpa and Grandma Longneck have appeared in all The Land Before Time films.

Littlefoot's Mother.
Appearing only in the original The Land Before Time, Littlefoot's mother was shown a very loving mother to her only son. (However, as the broken eggs in her nest show, it is more precise to say that Littlefoot was her only surviving son.) She got along well with her parents and loved her husband Bron very much, naming their son after him. ("Littlefoot" was Bron's nickname as a child.) She also led the herd in search of the Great Valley. At the time of her son's birth, the land was suffering geologic and ecologic upheavels that included but were limited to, drought, flooding, famine, predation, and earthquake. Determined that her son not grow up in such an environment, she led her herd in search of the Great Valley "a wonderful, beautiful place" with green food, "more than you could ever eat, and with more fresh, cool water than you could ever drink." She had no proof that the Great Valley even existed but she was guided by her knowledge that "somethings, you see with your heart."

she woke up and saw her son was gone. She heard his and cera's scream's and arived just in time.how ever after a huge battle having the sharptooth jump on her back and bite into her and being bashed agenst a rock she thought she had achieved victorie but she had to save the children once more finally pushing the sharptooth down the ledge.Unfortunately,her atempt left her to die. With her last breath, she told her son to search for the Great Valley and that she would be with him. Her ghost would appear to her son in times of need and aid him in the quest for the Great Valley. Her last appearance was at the end of the first film when Littlefoot despaired of ever finding the Great Valley and she or her ghost took to the form of a longneck cloud to guide him into the Great Valley where on a beam of light came from her heart. The light shone on Littlefoot and spread to illuminate the Great Valley below.

Though long since dead, she is periodically mentioned through the film series and she may have made an appearance in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island. Littlefoot remembers his mother and looks at a star shining brighter than the others. She also made an appearance in a flashback in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration.

From her portryal and her family's memories of her, she appears to have been a good person, though she was not quite as enlightened as her son. She acquiesced to species segregation, not because she necessarily liked it but because "it's always been that way." Like human parents who, in real life, seek to raise their children in racially homogenous Sundown towns, part of the reason that Littlefoot's mother sought to raise him in the Valley was because "there will be many, many longnecks for you to play with." However, the fact that she saved both Littlefoot and  Cera and from Sharptooth shows that she was willing to abandon racial taboos. Her true name is unknown. She is often just called Littlefoot's Mother and sometimes Mama Longneck. She is likely Grandpa and Grandma Longneck's daughter as how her husband refers to the old one as Poppa Longneck instead of father.it is unkown if Ali's Mother is her or bron's
sister.

Petrie's Mother.
She is shown to have a big heart like her son. She still loves her brother, Pterano, even if he did all of those terrible things.

Petrie's Brothers and Sisters.
They had brief appearances in The Land Before Time, The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, and The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire. They have a bigger part in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

They are voiced by Jeff Bennett (who voices Petrie), Nika Futterman, and Susan Blu.

Pterano.
He is Petrie's maternal uncle. While idolized by his nephew he is not trusted by his sister (Petrie's mother), nor by Grandpa Longneck and Topsy. That is seen in how after the combined herds joined under Grandpa Longneck in search of the Great Valley, Pterano promised them an easy way to the Valley and, due to his incompetent leadership, blundered them into a sharptooth ambush (they were never heard from again). After reuniting with his sister in the Great Valley, he, along with his henchmen Rinkus (a pink flyer) and Sierra (a brown flyer), began searching for the Stone of Cold Fire, a comet which he thinks will grant him magic power. He fails and winds up putting Petrie and the other children in danger, but saves them at the end. For that, Grandpa Longneck exiles Pterano for a  period of 5 cold times (winters/years).

Pterano appears in The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire and has not been seen since. It was rumoured he would appear in the upcoming The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers but  Michael York (who provided Pterano's voice) has confirmed that he isn't appearing.

Shorty.
A dark green Brachiosaurus, he appeared in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. In Bron's backstory, he was found wandering in the wilderness with eight or so orange Brachiosaurus hatchlings. Since he was the eldest of the small herd, he is shown in the flashback to be very protective of the hatchlings. Shorty, along with the hatchlings, followed Bron.

In the crater, Shorty and Littlefoot didn't get along well until near the end of the movie, when Littlefoot stopped him from leaving the crater by himself.  Littlefoot proposed the two could be brothers, which made Shorty happier and less jealous of Littlefoot. In the end, he gets on well with Littlefoot's friends and Bron finally adopts him after Littlefoot tells Bron to take care of Shorty.

Shorty is the young bully of the film, since he had a nasty past and was the only one from that small herd that wasn't adopted (until the end of the film).  He was antisocial, mostly wandering by himself and picking on other young dinosaurs, including Littlefoot. His name is ironic in that "Shorty" is a playground insult, but he is also shorter than Littlefoot even though he is clearly older than him.

Topsy.
Topsy is a Triceratops, the father of Cera. For many films, his true name was unknown and was credited as "Daddy Topps" in the first film and "Cera's Dad" in the first ten sequels to the film. There has been some argument over whether or not Topsy is his real name and not a petname given him by Tria. This is seen in how Cera was visibly angered when Ducky called him that. Even so, it is assumed that Topsy is indeed his real name.

His personality was unknown in the first film but he was shown to be guilty of racism, or speciesism, growling at Littlefoot (whom he sees as a bad influence on Cera) and telling him that "Threehorns never play with longnecks." He was often portrayed as pompous, self-rightous, and bigoted; the degree of his pride and stubbornness was seen in The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving when he took Cera straight into a forest fire rather than go with the other dinosaurs. He is aware of his bad attitude but, in the beginning at least, he thought nothing of it saying that even if was thought mean, he had a family to protect and he would do that by any means necessary. In a song from The Time of the Great Giving he says that was inculcated with this attitude by his own father, who told him to "stand and fight, don't run away." In recent films, he has still been shown as stern and less understanding than Grandpa Longneck, but his prejudice and bad attitude have drastically (but gradually) lessened through the many sequels.

There is also the question of where Topsy's wife/mate is - indeed, the last film The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses, shows him happily seeing Tria; Littlefoot was shown asking if she would be Cera's new mother. Topsy's mate was shown near the start of  The Land Before Time as were their other children. However, when he and Cera were reunited at the end of the film, some of the other children were gone, his wife as well as the other featured children disappearing afterwards as the result of an accidental retcon. Given the fatalistic attitude of the first film (the narrator stated that "Sharpteeth stalked the herds waiting to seize any who strayed") it is likely they died on the way to the Great Valley. However, as seen by the presence of Topsy's grandchildren, Dinah and Dana, in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock, at least one of his children, unnamed and likely from before Cera's egg-laying, is alive. After Invasion of the Tinysauruses, Topsy and Tria have another daughter, Tricia.

In recent films, he has been shown to be part of the Great Valley's leadership, sharing power with Littlefoot's grandfather. Though Topsy and Littlefoot's family met early in the first film, it is assumed that he and Grandpa Longneck were formally introduced to each other and decided to assume shared leadership of the combined herds after they were separated from their children in the great earthquake. This was shown in a flashback in The Stone of Cold Fire.

Topsy is portrayed by Burke Byrnes in The Land Before Time and John Ingle in all of the sequels, except The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists, where he never made an appearance.

Tria.
Tria is a pink "Three Horn" (Triceratops). She is kind, loving and brave, though her character may seem rather false and unconvincing at first. It is revealed in The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses that she and Topsy (Cera's dad) met when they were younger, and are reunited in the film, much to the dismay of Cera. Despite some false starts, however, Tria and her new stepdaughter do manage to get along in the end. Unlike Topsy, Tria immediately finds the Tinysauruses cute when she comes across a wandering pair, which is why she separates from him for a short time. Tria and Topsy have a child in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

She is portrayed by Camryn Manheim in the sequels and Jessica Gee-George in the TV series.

Tricia.
Tricia is a young light-pink Triceratops. She is the daughter of Tria and Topsy and the half-sister of Cera. Her first appearance is in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

Minor Characters.
Ali.
Ali is an apatosaurus who bears a striking resemblance to Littlefoot apart from her dark pink skin colour and light blue eyes.  She and her mother belong to a herd that was forced to leave their homeland due to flooding and excess rain. (This was likely the same changing of the Land that was referred to in the first film.) With their old home turned from the Valley of Mists into the Land of Mists, Ali's herd, led by the matriarch called the Old One, was forced to leave.

During Migration, Ali's herd found the Great Valley and were welcomed by their "cousins," Grandpa Longneck's herd. However, Grandpa Longneck fell ill and Ali and Littlefoot left the Great Valley to search Ali's old home for the fabled Night Flower that would heal Littlefoot's ailing grandfather. Cera, Ducky, Petrie, and Spike soon followed them, and met up with Littlefoot and Ali. Together, the group found the Night Flowers and brought them to the Great Valley to heal Grandpa Longneck. Afterwards, Ali and her herd left the Valley to continue their migration even though she and Littlefoot would one day meet again. However, the narrator assures us that that is another story. So far, this statement has been ironic; she has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Like most dinosaurs outside of the Great Valley herd, Ali was wary of trusting dinosaurs outside of her species and, on her part, Cera initially didn't trust Ali, but later learned to accept her and the two became friends. Fanfiction often has Littlefoot and Ali fall in love and marry as adults. She appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

In The Land Before Time TV series, Ali returns with the herd.  She meets a new friend, Red when her herd and another met and joined together.

Ali's Mother.
Archie.
Archie was an old Archelon and appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.  He may have been inspired by Crusty the Turtle, a character who appeared on a 1989 animated series very similar to The Land Before Time called Dink, the Little Dinosaur.  Both characters were shown to live in caves and give advice to the main character, an Apatosaurus (Littlefoot/Dink), and his multi-species group of friends, including a Pteranadon (Petrie/Flapper) and a hadrosaur or duck-billed dinosaur (Ducky/Amber and Scat).

Big Daddy.
The leader of the Tinysauruses, he is not only the voice of authority, but he is over-protective and thinks he is the biggest out of the Tinysaurus herd. He has been met with much derision from his daughters.

Chatter.
Doc.
Doc is a wandering Diplodocus (longneck) who goes "where the road takes him." He is shown to be very taciturn and not forthcoming in his past. Also, The Dinosaur Filmography describes his voice as being as gravelly as a bone bed.

Shortly after appearing in the Great Valley, he saved Littlefoot who quickly went on to idolize the wanderer. Littlefoot believed Doc to be legendary "Lone Dinosaur" who saved the Great Valley long ago from the most terrible sharptooth. He bases these assumptions on the fact that Doc can do fancy tricks with his tail, he's been to the Great Valley before, he has a scar on his eye and he has a resemblance to Saurus Rock. To a degree, Littlefoot places him above his own grandfather and defends him, Doc, when he is accused of bringing bad luck to the Valley. Towards the end, Doc and Grandpa Longneck work together to save Littlefoot from an Allosaurus and a Tyrannosaurus; Littlefoot asks Doc to stay in case the Valley should ever need a hero but Doc replies that the Valley already has a hero and looks towards Grandpa Longneck.

Doc appears in The Land Before Time VI: The Secret of Saurus Rock. Prior to The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, some fans asked if Doc was in fact, Littlefoot's father.

Elsie.
Elsie is a kind plesiosaurus that Littlefoot and friends met in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island.  

After trying to find food for the dislocated members of the Great Valley to keep the group together, Littlefoot and the others get marooned on an island, where the vast ocean surronding it prevents the homesick Littlefoot and gang from leaving, for they had a fear of 'swimming sharpteeth'. Their problem is eventually solved when Elsie appears, offering the kids a ride to the mainland.  They accept, and they travel safely back to the other members of the Great Valley, who have found enough food to last them until they could finally return to the Great Valley.

Guido.
Guido is a Microraptor who appears in The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.  Although rumoured to be multicoloured, his feathers are, in actuality, presented in warm shades of green and yellow, mostly Jade, and he has never seen another creature like himself.  He is more of a comic relief character than previous guest characters, and he is voiced by Rob Paulsen.

Hyp.
The leader of the trio of bullying dinosaurs in The Land Before Time III: The Time of the Great Giving, who tried to cause trouble for Littlefoot and his friends. Hyp, along with his other friends Mutt and Nod, has a bad attitude on the outside but he often hides his cowardliness to make him look braver, or "bigger". Eventually, Hyp and his friends lighten up and help Littlefoot and his friends with helping their parents deal with a pack of Sharpteeth, and later some food to share with others. The trio has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Hyp's Father.
An often grumpy dinosaur, he yells at his son when he's concerned for his safety. Like his son, his attitude may have an effect on others, including Topsy, who realises the errors of his ways on raising his daughter, Cera, after witnessing Hyp's father telling off his son with the exact same words Topsy used with Cera ("I'm your father, and I know what's best for you!"). Hyp's father is not cowardly but he is not always angry; he can also be kind to others, as shown at the end of the film. In V he can be seen when the dinosaurs are leaving the valley but he is blue.

Lizzie.
Lizzie was one of the Tinysauruses Littlefoot and friends met in Invasion of the Tinysauruses.  A daughter of Big Daddy, she was fed up with her father's over-protectiveness and distrust of Littlefoot and his friends, similar to Cera's situation with her father, Topsy. Lizzie and Cera quickly became friends and made amends with their fathers. Voiced by Cree Summer.

Mo.
Mo is a colourful Ophthalmosaurus who first made his debut appearance in The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. He is incredibly playful, especially with his "mud brother", Littlefoot, but his boisterous antics could try the patience of some, including Cera. He is bilingual in that he can speak both Littlefoot's herbivore and his native dolphin-like languages, which the  dinosaurs don't understand (Mo tried to warn them about an approaching Liopleurodon, which the dinosaurs found funny rather than cautious).

So far, he is the only character to appear as a notable cameo in the latest sequels. In The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration, he is seen jumping out of the water during the "Adventuring" musical number. He can also be seen during the "Flip, Flap and Fly" music video for the upcoming The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers.

Mutt.
One of the bullying trio, he is dim-witted and more dependent on his friends. Because he is not so bright, he is more of a coward than Hyp or Nod. He is a Muttaburrasaurus and his name is inspired by his Latin species name.

Mutt's Father.
He can be seen briefly in the fight against the raptors and in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze saying that after Topsy slipped from his nest he slammed into his nose.

Nod.
Another of Hyp's friends, a Nodosaurus.

Old One.
She is the leader of the migrating Apatosaurus in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists. She is regarded by her herd as the wisest, although some find her claims hard to believe (Littlefoot questions her views on whether retrieving the Night Flower from the Land of Mists is too dangerous, for example).

Pat.
An old but not always wise Apatosaurus, he offered to look after Littlefoot's friends on their way to the crater in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. When they realise they cannot make the journey by themselves, Pat finally looks after them. His leg was severely burned from erupting lava after telling the longneck creation myth to the gang, but they help Pat escape from possibly dying by helping him get up. When they arrive at the crater, he helps defend the other children against three sharpteeth. At the end of the movie, the children ask him to come with them to the Great Valley, which he slowly accepts.

Pat is shown to be a lonely traveller, as he offers twice to look after Littlefoot's friends, takes a different route to the crater and does not travel with a sauropod herd. He is gentle but because of his age he is physically weak. He was voiced by James Garner and has not appeared since in the further sequels.

Rainbow Faces.

Red.

Red is a Apatosaurus who resembles Littlefoot, and has large eyes.  He was introduced in The Land Before Time TV series, when Ali shows up in The Great Valley.  At first, Red boasts about himself and told Ali stories about him protecting his herd, and convinced her that they were real.  Littlefoot, Cera, Ducky, Spike, Petrie, Chomper, and Ruby plan a scheme to convince Ali that Red has been making up all of the stories when Chomper acts as a mean Sharptooth, and scares him away.  After, Red admits to making up the stories when the Old One finds out.  He then becomes friends with the gang.

Rooter.
Rooter was an old armored dinosaur. He made only one appearance in the original The Land Before Time but was one of the more powerful characters from that film and his actions are still felt today. After Littlefoot was orphaned, he was wandering and came across the taciturn and almost disagreeable Rooter. He angrily told Littlefoot to stop crying but stopped when he learned that Littlefoot's mother was dead. He said, "Now you pay attention to old Rooter." and told the young dinosaur that the Great Circle of Life had begun but not everyone made it back together at the end. Counseling Littlefoot through his grief, he said that he'd always miss his mother but that she would always be with him as long as he remembered the things she'd taught him. "In a way, you'll never be apart for you are still a part of each other." When Littlefoot said that his stomach hurt, Rooter said "That too will go in time little fella... only in time."

Rooter was added to the film to help soften the emotional blow from the intense Sharptooth attack and the scene depicting the death of Littlefoot's mother. Though it was Rooter's only appearance, Bron would later remember somebody telling him of what happened to his mother. Some mistake the dinosaur he mentioned to be Rooter, but Bron also mentioned he heard no word about Littlefoot from this dinosaur. Rooter's voice actor was also the narrator of the first film, Pat Hingle.

Rocky and Dusty.
Skitter.
Sue.
A bright pink Supersaurus, she saved Littlefoot from a crocodile by simply crushing its face in The Land Before Time X: The Great Longneck Migration. She wishes for a mate and once in the crater, she finally finds an Ultrasaurus, a sauropod taller than herself. Sue is kind and gentle, but her real personality remains a mystery because of her short amount of screen time. She was voiced by Bernadette Peters.

Mr. Thicknose.
Mr. Thicknose, a Pachyrhinosaurus, is, or was, a very respected individual in the Great Valley community and served as a teacher to the children of the Valley. However, his pedagogy was that of being a "know-it-all." The adults of the Valley would send him their children to receive a primary education; they assumed that Mr. Thicknose was indeed a polymath and could effectivily instruct their children.

However, this changed during the Big Freeze. When Littlefoot proved that he saw snow; when this happened, Mr. Thicknose was verbally attacked by the grownups for not warning them so they could store away their food before the snow got heavier. Broken hearted, he walks away to near the pass to sit down and sulk; he apparently sits for some time, judging by the snow on him. He then accompanies Littlefoot and the others to the Mysterious Beyond where they have an accounter with a "sharp-tooth" and find a hot spring, with much food. There, they discover the truth that Mr. Thicknose has never been to the Mysterious Beyond before, and his knowldege comes not from primary sources (that is, his own research) but rather from secondary sources (stories from far walkers or migrating herds. This should not diminish his position as a teacher, however. Some of the best professors use secondary sources).

Though he does remain in the Great Valley, he has not been since the Big Freeze. It is not known whether or not he resumed his teaching position.

He appeared in the film The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze and has been seen in the Land Before Time (TV series)|The Land Before Time TV series].

His name reflects his species name which means "thick nose lizard" or "thick nose reptile." Other dinosaurs have been known to have species names as surnames or family names such as Mr. Clubtail. Curiously, with how Topsy and Grandpa Longneck call each other longneck and three-horn, this could mean that the two leaders of the Great Valley combined herds also have their species names as surnames as well. (Hence, Mr. Topsy Three-horn.)

Tickles.
The mouselike Tickles is the first mammal seen in The Land Before Time film series. Sentient but mute, he is of unknown species (presumably a Megazostrodon, but may be unlikely) and was named because he, in Ducky's words, had "tickly fuzzies all over him." He appears in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

Tinysauruses.
The Tinysauruses are a small herd of kitten-sized, multicolored sauropods that made their debut in The Land Before Time XI: Invasion of the Tinysauruses. Their name is a portmanteau of "tiny" and "-sauruses". Unlike their slower relatives, they are quite fast and are very lightweight, and their small size is useful for crawling into small spaces. In the film, Littlefoot accuses the Tinysauruses for knocking down and stealing tree-sweets from the tree-sweet tree. Because of this, the other dinosaurs are eventually fearful of these rather alien creatures, and have a desire to kill them if they could. When Littlefoot befriends these creatures, however, they turn out to be more sentient than he imagined.

Tippy.
A pink Stegosaurus, he is Spike's playful companion during the stegosaur migration in The Land Before Time VIII: The Big Freeze. When a stegosaur herd moved into the Great Valley, Spike immediately became close friends with Tippy. Unlike Spike, Tippy is very vocal; his catchphrase is "Fun, fun, fun!". He was voiced by Jeremy Suarez, who later did the voice of Koda in Brother Bear. Tippy has not appeared since.

Tippy's Mother.
Villains.
Ichy and Dil.
Ichy and Dil were an Ichthyornis and a crocodile, perhaps a Deinosuchus respectively. Though they thouroughly disliked each other ("I need you like I need a disease!" "Oh yeah, well I need you like the sun needs to freeze!"), they made a working partnership in which small but "eagle-eyed" Ichy would spot prey and near sighted but very big Dill would move in for the kill. They were first stalking prey in a large cave until they came across Littlefoot and his friends. They then followed them to Ali's old home, now the Valley of Mists and there in the rivers and waterways almost ate them before Dil was chased off by an angry plesiosaur. Ichy was sent flying by a tree branch.

They appeared in The Land Before Time IV: Journey Through the Mists.

Ozzy and Strut.
Ozzy and Strut are two Struthiomimus brothers who entered the Great Valley in hopes of stealing eggs, though the more relaxed Strut had hoped to eat plants. They were bumbling villains who wound up being chased out of the Great Valley by Chomper's vengeful parents.

Their first appearance was in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure. However, that was not the first appearance of a Struthiomimus, or egg stealers as they are called. The first was in the original The Land Before Time where one tried to steal Littlefoot as an egg. Also, during that film's end credits, a Struthiomimus, or egg stealer is shown creeping into the Valley. This may or may not be Ozzy.

Redclaw.
Redclaw is a male Tyrannosaurus who has a distinctive scar that that goes through his left eye. He is the prominent antagonist in the TV series.

Rinkus and Sierra.
Appearing only in The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire, they are originally friends of Pterano, but appear more sinister then their associate, particularly Sierra. They assist in the kidnapping of Ducky and attempt a treason on Pterano. It was believed that they were burned at the end of The Land Before Time VII: The Stone of Cold Fire. The Internet Movie Database mistakes Sierra to be in The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water. Rinkus and Sierra were once announced to appear in the upcoming film The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers, but this decision was apparently dropped.

Rinkus was voiced by Rob Paulsen (who also voiced Spike, Chomper, Mo, and Guido) and Sierra was voiced by Jim Cummings.

Screech.
Screech is one of the two Velociraptor companions of Redclaw.

Sharptooth.


Sharpteeth are carnivorous dinosaurs, that are the film series' main antagonists. Each film typically brings in a new sharptooth or two, usually involving a conflict between either the two sharpteeth or the sharpteeth and the dinosaurs living in the Great Valley at the climax of the film. 

Sharpteeth live in the area known as the 'Mysterious Beyond', the land outside of the Great Valley. The Great Valley is surrounded by great mountains, preventing sharpteeth from entering. However, in the event of a landslide, as in The Land Before Time II: The Great Valley Adventure, sharpteeth find a way in.

The characters have a one-sided view of sharpteeth (save for Chomper, who is a sharptooth himself), some going as far as calling them unintelligent and dangerous. Throughout the series, however, some sharpteeth have proven to be kind. Chomper and his parents showed kindness to Littlefoot and his friends in The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island (although Chomper's parents needed some persuasion).

Swimming Sharptooth.
In some of the films in which water was prominently featured, most notably The Land Before Time V: The Mysterious Island, The Land Before Time IX: Journey to Big Water and The Land Before Time XII: The Great Day of the Flyers, swimming carnivores such as Liopleurodon and sharks are called swimming sharpteeth.

Mo and Elsie are examples of creatures deemed "swimming sharpteeth", although the two of them are harmless, even helping Littlefoot and his friends.

Jacob Warrick (1773 - 1811) was an Indiana militia leader.

Jacob Warrick was born in 1773, Warrick's Station, in Greenbrier County, West Virginia. Jacob was the son of John Warrick, who fought at the Battle of Point Pleasant, in Lord Dunmore's War in 1774. Jacob Warrick moved on to Nicholas County, Kentucky.

In 1795, Warrick married Jane Montgomery, in Virginia. She was the daughter of Thomas Montgomery, who settled in Montgomery County, Kentucky in 1793.

The Montgomery family arrived in Gibson County, Indiana, in 1805, and the Warricks arrived in 1806. Warrick, together with Thomas Montgomery, burned the last Native American village in Gibson County in 1807, and pursued the Natives into Illinois.

Capt. Jacob Warrick commanded a company in the Indiana militia during Tecumseh's War. He was killed on November 7, 1811, at the Battle of Tippecanoe.

Jane Montgomery died in 1846, in Gibson County, Indiana.

<doc id="5210426" title="Moody's Mood for Love" nonfiltered="165" processed="163" dbindex="1480165">
"Moody's Mood for Love" is jazz saxophonist James Moody's instrumental solo on the song "I'm in the Mood for Love." Later, jazz singer Eddie Jefferson wrote lyrics to this improvisation by Moody. This particular arrangement of the song did not come to be known by its now common title of "Moody's Mood for Love" until King Pleasure released a very popular vocal version in 1952. King Pleasure's version included vocals by Blossom Dearie as well as instrumental contributions from Teacho and Band. Other artists who later released renditions of the song include George Benson, Aretha Franklin, Queen Latifah, Quincy Jones, Tito Puente, Amy Winehouse and Georgie Fame.  In 2006, American Idol contestant Elliott Yamin remade the song. His version appears on the album American Idol Season 5: Encores. This version just missed the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number one on Billboard's Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles chart. The TONY award-winning musical Jersey Boys featured the song. The song also has been featured on an episode of The Cosby Show. 

The lyrics are often incorrectly attributed to King Pleasure because he was the first to record it. However, some sources report that when Pleasure was asked to write more lyrics to solos he confessed that he had not written this one. He had heard Jefferson perform it in a jazz club some years before and asked permission to reproduce it. James Moody later hired Jefferson to come on the road with him. Jefferson also appears on several recordings with Moody.

Another repercussion of Jefferson s lyrical marriage to Moody s solo was the impacted it had on jazz singer Jon Hendricks. The story goes that Hendricks was sitting in a café when the King Pleasure recording of Moody s Mood came on the jukebox. According to Hendricks, he had been writing  unpopular  songs for some time, but when he heard the recording and realized that it was a saxophone solo with words he decided to change his approach to songwriting.  I didn t have to stop at 32 bars. Now I could write lyrics for all the parts in the orchestra.  He went on to collaborate with singer/arranger, Dave Lambert, and singer, Annie Ross, to form the group Lambert, Hendricks & Ross LHR. The group multi-tracked their voices and recorded the album  Sing a Song of Basie  in which they sang lyrics be Hendricks to the full arrangements of the Count Basie Orchestra (Ross singing all the trumpet parts, Hendricks singing the saxophone parts and Lambert singing the trombone parts). With the exception of a small rhythm section all 13 horn parts were reproduced by the three voices dubbed over.

<doc id="1873207" title="Windows XP 64-bit Edition" nonfiltered="166" processed="164" dbindex="1480166">





Microsoft Windows XP 64-bit Edition was a version of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system designed to run on Intel Itanium family of microprocessors in their native IA-64 mode. It should not be confused with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, which is designed for x86-64 processors.

Two major versions of Windows 64-bit Edition were released:
 Windows XP 64-bit Edition for Itanium systems, Version 2002   Based on Windows XP codebase, which was released in 2001;
 Windows XP 64-bit Edition, Version 2003   Based on Windows Server 2003 codebase, which added support for the Itanium 2 processor, was released on March 28, 2003. ;

Windows XP 64-bit didn't fall into one of Microsoft's then current Windows XP product lines ('Home', 'Professional', 'Media Center' or 'Tablet') but was a separate edition made solely for the Itanium processor and its 64-bit instructions. However it was mostly analogous to Windows XP Professional Edition, but with some limitations:

 Initially it lacked most media applications such as Windows Media Player, NetMeeting, Windows Movie Maker, and integrated CD burning, although WMP and NetMeeting were added in the 2003 version.
 Numerous old technologies such as DAO, Jet database and most notably NTVDM were removed, so support for MS-DOS, POSIX, OS/2, and Win16 applications is absent.

However, unlike previous alternate architecture ports of Windows (Windows NT 4.0 for PowerPC, MIPS R4x00, and Alpha) Windows XP 64-bit Edition could run standard x86 32-bit applications through its WOW64 (Windows on Windows) emulation layer. While the original Itanium processor contained an on-chip IA-32 decoder, it was deemed far too slow for serious use (Running at about 400MHz), so Microsoft and Intel wrote a software 32 to 64 bit translator dubbed the IA-32 Execution Layer. It allowed real time translation of x86 32-bit instructions into IA-64 instructions, allowing legacy 32-bit applications to run (albeit significantly more slowly than native code). 

Criticism.

Windows XP 64-bit Edition could not use 32-bit drivers and services (except for codecs such as XviD, which were actually 32-bit DLLs so they could be used if media players are 32-bit). Thus, many (older) devices are incompatible with this version of Windows. 

Security updates were discontinued for Windows XP 64-bit Edition because of the more recent release Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.  Many fans of old DOS games have been reluctant to install 64-bit edition since the 64-bit edition lacks support for DOS applications.

As of December 2005, there were 482 hotels and resorts operating under the brand.

During America's Bicentential in 1976, Marriott opened two identical amusement parks in Santa Clara, California and Gurnee, Illinois.  The California park is now owned by Paramount Parks.  The Illinois park is now owned by Six Flags.  There are some obvious visuals still remaining at both parks regarding their days as Marriott parks.  The original theme was American patriotism.  The imagery of "Old Glory" and other American icons still are displayed in some architecture.  Both parks boast one double-decker merry-go-round each.  The California park dismantled its "Triple Wheel" ferris wheel.  

In September 2005, Marriot Hotels & Resorts unveiled its first new room designs in ten years. Dubbed mSpot, the new rooms feature clean lines and updated technology, and are intended to be younger, urban and more hip than they had been previously.

Barbier is a lunar impact crater that is located on the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It forms a matched pair with Cyrano crater to the north-northwest, and it lies to the southeast of the huge Garagin walled-plain. Southwest of Barbier crater is Sierpinski crater, and to the southeast is the Mare Ingenii.

The outer rim of Barbier crater has been eroded somewhat by subsequent impacts, particularly at the north end where the wall has been degraded by several small craterlets. A small crater lies across the eastern rim, and the southern rim is wider and irregular in shape. A small crater lies near where a central peak would be located, offset slightly to the east of the mid-point.

Satellite craters.
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater mid-point that is closest to Barbier crater.

inspirations for a new generation of music, rock and roll.]]

Willie Dixon (July 1, 1915   January 29, 1992) was a well-known American blues bassist, singer, songwriter, and record producer.

Career.
He was born as William James Dixon, in Vicksburg, Mississippi. He was a producer for Chess and Checker Records in Chicago and is considered one of the key figures in the creation of Chicago blues.  He worked with Chuck Berry, Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, Led Zeppelin, Otis Rush, Bo Diddley, Little Walter, Sonny Boy Williamson, Koko Taylor, Little Milton, Eddie Boyd, Jimmy Witherspoon, Lowell Fulson, Willie Mabon, Memphis Slim, Washboard Sam, and others.

He had a colourful life.  In his teens he had many scrapes with the law, and decided to hitchhike his way to Chicago.  A giant of a man, he took up boxing, and was so successful as to win the Golden Gloves heavywight title in 1936.  His progess in learning to play the bass was halted when he resisted the World War II draft, and was imprisoned for ten months.  After the war, he re-united with his bass playing tutor, Baby Doo Caston, forming the Big Three Trio, who went on to record for Columbia Records.  Dixon subsequently signed for Chess Records as a recording artist, but by 1951 he was a full time employee of the label.  His relationship with them was sometimes strained, although his spell there covered the years from 1948 to the early 1960s.  During this time his output, and influence was prodigious.   
Indeed, he once claimed "I am the blues."  This may seem a little arrogant, but there is no doubt that he was one of the major influences on the genre, through his original and varied songwriting, live performances, recording, and copious production work. He later recorded on Bluesville Records.

His double bass playing was of a high standard.  He appears on many of Chuck Berry's early recordings, further proving his linkage between the blues and the birth of rock 'n' roll.

Dixon's genius as a songwriter, lay in refurbishing archaic Southern motifs, in contemporary arrangements.  This produced songs with the backbone of the blues, and the agility of pop music.  British R&B bands of the 1960's constantly drew on the Dixon songbook for inspiration.

In addition, as his songwriting and production work started to take a backseat, his organisational ability was utilised, putting together all-star, Chicago based blues ensembles for work in Europe.

His health deteriorated in the 1970s and 1980s, due to long-term diabetes, and eventually his leg had to be amputated.  It was during this latter period of his life that Willie Dixon was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  As the songlist below demonstrates, his work was covered by a varied range of artists, from the blues, to modern day rock music practitioners.

Willie Dixon died of heart failure in Burbank, California in 1992 and was buried in the Burr Oak Cemetery in Alsip, Illinois.

The John Adams Building is one of three library buildings of the Library of Congress in the United States. The building was originally built simply as an annex to the Library's Main Building (the Thomas Jefferson Building). It opened its doors to the public on January 3, 1939.

History.
The idea to construct a new library building was presented to the United States Congress in 1928 at the urging of Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam. The bill was sponsored by Robert Luce, chairman of the House Committee on the Library. On June 13, 1930, $6,500,00 was appropriated for the building's construction, for a tunnel connecting it to the Main Building, and for changes in the east front of the Main Building, including the construction of a Rare Book Room. An additional appropriation approved on June 6, 1935, brought the total authorization to $8,226,457.

Architect of the Capitol David Lynn took charge of the project and commissioned the Washington architectural firm of Pierson & Wilson to design the building, with Alexander Buel Trowbridge as consulting architect. The contract stipulated completion by June 24, 1938, but the building was not ready for occupancy until December 2, 1938. The move of the Card Division started on December 12, and it opened its doors to the public in the new building on January 3, 1939.

The building is five stories in height above ground, with the fifth story set back 35 feet. It contains 180 miles of shelving (compared to 104 miles in the Jefferson Building) and can hold ten million volumes. There are 12 tiers of stacks, extending from the cellar to the fourth floor. Each tier provides about 13 acres of shelf space.

On April 13, 1976, in a ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial marking the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, US President Gerald Ford signed into law the act to change the name of the Library of Congress Annex Building to the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building. On June 13, 1980, the structure acquired its present name, which honors John Adams, the former President of the United States who in 1800 approved the law establishing the Library of Congress.

The building is faced in white Georgia marble and incorporated the use of new materials at the time such as acoustical block, formica, vitrolit, and glass tubing.

An eternal flame is a flame or torch that burns constantly, fed by a measured supply of propane gas or natural gas.  It is most often used as a symbol to acknowledge and remember a person or event of national significance, or a group of brave and noble people connected to some event, or even a laudable goal such as international peace.

The eternal flame to commemorate President Kennedy in the United States in 1963 was the first time in the world that an individual person was given such an honor.  Henceforward, eternal flames would be designated more frequently around the world to honor the loss of persons of great significance, in addition to major tragic events.

Eternal flames exist in nature as well, as byproducts of natural gas deposits leaking through the ground.

Parton v Milk Board (Vic) (1949) 80 CLR 229 is a High Court of Australia case that dealt with the meaning of excise in relation to section 90 of the Australian Constitution.

In this case, the tax was calculated as a fixed amount per gallon of milk, and imposed on retailers, instead of at the production phase; this was held to be invalid as imposing a duty of excise. This heralded in the broad approach to section 92 - where a "tax upon a commodity at any point in the course of distribution before it reaches the consumer produces the same effect as a tax upon its manufacture or production" (per Dixon J). Rich and Williams JJ agreed with Dixon J, stating that a tax at a later stage in the handling of a good is in effect a tax on the production or manufacture of the good.

Latham CJ dissented, using Peterswald v Bartley, and McTiernan J felt that it should be employed in a narrower sense, to make it fit within what he perceived to be the object of the section, which was to promote a "uniform fiscal policy for the Commonwealth".

Penco is a Municipality and comuna of Chile (the third oldest in the country) in the Concepción Province of the Bío-Bío Region. The name Penco comes from Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche people, and means "Peumo water".

In previous centuries, in the current location of Penco, was established the city of Concepción, now the capital of the Bío-Bío Region. Due to earthquakes and tsunamis, which razed the city in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the authorities decided to move the city to its current location to the Valle de la Mocha, along side the Bío-Bío River. The habitants who did not abandon the territory of Penco, formed the town that exists today.

To an outsider, there may be confusion between the demonyms of the inhabitants of Concepción and Penco.  Due to the previous location of Concepción, inhabitants of that city are called penquistas while inhabitants of Penco are known as pencones.

The Royal Burgess Golfing Society is a parkland golf course and is considered to be one of the oldest courses in Scotland. It is currently an exclusive golf club (situated in the area of Barnton, Edinburgh, capital of Scotland)  where the golfers are mainly middle aged and elderly men, as the club has a strict clientele. It can take a long time for a person to become a member as they must be seconded, thirded etc. Notable members include Jack Nicklaus alongside a host of royals, aristocrats and socialites.

Membership costs around £1,000 per year with initial membership around 3 to 4 times that. Women are not permitted in the member's bar but are allowed in other areas of the club if accompanied by a member.


 History .

The Royal Burgess Golfing Society first started in the Bruntsfield Links, but moved to Musselburgh Links in 1874, due to overcrowding. However, the same problem arose when in the late 1800s, golf started to become popular. They moved to their current Barnton course in 1894. The Royal Burgess has only had it's current name since 1929 when King George V ordered the name be changed from 'The Edinburgh Burgess Golfing Society.' Royals having played at the Burgess and even some becoming members include from King George V and VI to King Edward VIII and, even today, HRH The Duke of York.

F.F (Foo Fighters) is a fictional character from the Japanese manga JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. F.F is one of Jolyne's allies in Part 6.



 Story .
Enrico Pucci had a shack of Stand disks near prison grounds, a collection of different Stands that he had collected over the years while in prison. It is generally untouched and desolate. However, he needed a guardian for these disks, least they fall in unwanted hands. He threw a random Stand disk into the ocean and hit plankton floating on the surface. Unexpectedly, F.F was born.

F.F, or Foo Fighters, was told to stay there by Pucci and to kill anyone (other than him) should they come close. Having no other purpose, she did as she was told. When Jolyne Kujo and Hermes Costello approached the shack during an outdoor activity, F.F attacked but was soundly beaten by both of them. Parched and close to disintergrating, she lamented on her meaningless life and wanted to have friends. Showing mercy, Jolyne spared her by giving her water, despite Hermes' protests. Fascinated by her savior, she showed Jolyne Jotaro Kujo
Jotaro's]] missing Stand disk in gratitude. She inhabited the body of a dead inmate and followed both of them back to prison. Although she likes the other people she have met, she has the strongest affinity for Jolyne since she gave her freedom.

Later, tricked by Pucci, she leads her friends into an ambush and suffers a severe blow to her body, knocking her Stand disk from her head. Dehydrated and nearing death, she was able to hear the dying Anasui's offer to her. He gave her permission to possess his body to pluck Jotaro's memory disk from him, not caring what happened to him as long as Jolyne would be happy. F.F. did pluck Jotaro's memory disk from Anasui's body but refused to possess it. Her spirit heals Anasui's wounds and thanks Jolyne for being her friend, glad that they met. When Jolyne pledged to retireve the disk to revive her, F.F declines, saying that it wouldn't be the real her but another F.F. She disappears in a gust of wind.

 Stand .

Foo Fighters (          f  fait zu): allows bundles of plankton to exist in a humanoid form. Interestingly, the plankton adopt the same name as the Stand. Technically, Foo Fighters has two forms: one where she is in a body and one where she is not. While not in a body, Foo Fighters has the ability to travel bodies of water super quick, spreading her plankton to faraway areas to manipulate whatever she chooses. In a body, she retains this ability by forming a pistol on her forefinger, shooting parts of herself to her enemies. The down side is that she has to be constatnly hydrated and can't fight for extended periods of time. Alternatively, F.F can heal people by using her plankton to microscopically sew wounds quickly together. Some of the most fatal wounds can be healed in a matter of seconds.

As with her name, the stand is also the name to the band Foo Fighters.

 Trivia .
 The body that F.F. inhibits belonged to a girl named Etro who is got her namesake from the fashion brand of the same name. The Initals F.F. are a marketing trademark done by the Fendi fashion brand, another tidbit to her name. ;
 Due to her plankton inhabiting the body she is in, F.F can contort in impossible curves and even slip through barred fences unharmed.
 Some people mistake F.F for a painter because of her overalls-like jumpsuit.
 When not close to a pipe or hose, she tries to keep a 32. oz cup near her at all times.
 True to her word, F.F. was the only main protagonist to not have a Steel Ball Run counterpart at the end of Part 6.

Hubbard Broadcasting Corporation is a broadcasting company based in St. Paul, Minnesota that was started by Stanley E. Hubbard.  The corporation has broadcast outlets scattered across Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, and New Mexico, though the flagships are the KSTP radio and television stations serving the Twin Cities region of Minnesota and western Wisconsin.

KSTP has its origins in the Twin Cities radio station WAMD ("Where All Minneapolis Dances"), which started broadcasting live dance music from a local ballroom on February 13, 1925.  It was the first radio station to be completely supportedy by income generated by running advertisements.  Hubbard Broadcasting now operates three radio stations as well as several television stations.

In 1928, WAMD merged with KFOY radio (first broadcast: March 12, 1924) in St. Paul to become KSTP, which was advertised as being operated by the National Battery Broadcasting Co. Ten years later, in 1938, Hubbard bought the first television camera available from RCA.  Following the television blackout brought on by World War II, KSTP started television broadcasts in 1948.  More recently in the 1980s and '90s, Hubbard Broadcasting attempted an entry into satellite TV and operated U.S. Satellite Broadcasting (USSB) for many years but this property was later sold off.

KSTP is still Hubbard's flagship, although there are now three different stations that carry that name.  KSTP-TV is affiliated with ABC.  KSTP-AM broadcasts a talk radio format, and KSTP-FM broadcasts adult contemporary music.

After the Federal Communications Commission relaxed rules about television station ownership, Hubbard bought a second television station in the Twin Cities.  Originally affiliated with the Home Shopping Network when it started operations in 1994, KVBM channel 45 was bought by Hubbard and began broadcasting as KSTC in 2000. The station is normally independent (not affiliated with any broadcast network), but it has been used by KSTP to broadcast ABC network programming when channel 5 is broadcasting coverage of Viking football games or other special shows, including severe-weather coverage.

Aside from terrestrial broadcast stations, other current ventures include the film network ReelzChannel (launched in 2006), arts network Ovation TV, and the Hubbard Radio Network, which is used to distribute KSTP-AM's local talk shows to subscribing radio stations in Minnesota and Wisconsin. The cable channels are run through subsidiary company Hubbard Media Group.

Hubbard Broadcasting also owned the now-closed Bound to be Read bookstores in St. Paul, Albuquerque, and Fort Myers.

John James "Fats" Dantonio (December 31, 1918 - May 28, 1993) was a  Major League Baseball catcher for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1944 and 1945.  "Fats" was 5'8" tall and weighed only 165 pounds.

Dantonio is one of many ballplayers who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II.  He made his major league debut on September 18, 1944 in a road game against the Boston Braves at Braves Field.

He played in just 3 games in '44, then batted .250 in 47 games the next season.  His career totals for 50 games include a .244 batting average (33-for-135), 12 runs batted in, 12 runs scored, a .301 on base percentage, and a .304 slugging percentage.  As a receiver he was well below average, making 14 errors in 182 total chances for a low fielding percentage of .923.

Dantonio passed away in his hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana at the age of 74.

Trivia.
Dantonio shares the exact same birthday (December 31, 1918) with former MLB catcher Al Lakeman.

Malyj Vysotskij (, ) is a Finnish island in Russian territory. It is located in Vyborg Bay, next to Vysotsk island, 12 km southwest of Vyborg. It is currently leased to Finland.

Between 1918 and 1940 the island was formally part of Finland, under the name Ravansaari. It was inhabited by nearly one thousand Finns who mainly earned their livelihood from the timber industry. In 1940, it was annexed by the Soviet Union and became part of Karelo Finnish SSR. In 1941, Ravansaari was recaptured by Finnish troops and annexed to Finland. In June 1944, the island fell to the Red Army and once again became part of the Soviet Union. The island was renamed Malyj Vysotskij. A treaty was signed in 1963 to lease the island and the nearby Saimaa Canal to Finland for fifty years.

Because of the treaty and the island's isolation from both Finland and Russia, radio amateurs have made the Malyj Vysotskij island an entity of its own, much like Hawaii or Alaska. This and the fact that Alexander Stepanovich Popov did his first radio experiments in the area at the turn of the 19th century makes the island an attractive destination for DX-peditioners. All such expeditions are organized by a Finnish-Russian group, the first of which occurred in 1988.

For the international monthly publication nicknamed Le Diplo, see Le Monde diplomatique and for the British title of the same name see Diplo magazine.
Diplo, Diplodocus, Wes Gully, and Wes Diplo are all pseudonyms of Wesley Pentz, a Philadelphia-based producer and DJ.  Together with DJ Low Budget, he runs Hollertronix, a club and music collective. In addition to his solo career, he has worked with British-based singer and artist M.I.A.. The two were also romantically involved. Pentz's alias, short for Diplodocus, derives from his childhood fascination with dinosaurs.

As a DJ, Diplo is characterized by his eclectic, often 80s-oriented mashups, mixtapes, and live sets.  On his full-length solo effort, Florida, however, his sound is closer to sample-based cinematic instrumental hip hop, like the work of DJ Shadow.

Born in Mississippi and raised across the southern United States, Diplo picked up much of the local culture while growing up there.  Music styles such as dirty south, crunk and Miami bass are now key ingredients of  Hollertronix's output.  Pentz's solo work is also influenced by Southern Gothic and other southern literature. Additionally, world music is a strong musical influence on Diplo, especially baile funk, which he encountered whilst traveling in Brazil.

Diplo is signed to the Ninja Tune-imprint Big Dada. In 2006, he started his own label, Mad Decent, signing Brazilian baile funk group Bonde do Role.

Pitchcapping refers to a form of torture devised by British forces in 18th century Ireland which was widely used against suspected rebels during the period of the 1798 Rebellion, most famously on Anthony Perry, one of the leaders of the Wexford rebels.



The process involved pouring hot pitch, or tar (mainly used at the time for lighting purposes), into a conical shaped paper "cap", which was forced onto a bound suspect's head and then allowed to cool. Less elaborate versions included smearing a cloth or paper with pitch and pressing onto the head of the intended victim. The "pitchcap" was then torn off taking lumps of skin and flesh with it which usually left the victim disfigured for life.   

The torture was usually preceded by the crude shearing of the victims hair and many accounts report that ears were often partly or fully severed during the cutting. Refinements to the torture included unbinding the victim's feet to allow the spectacle of them running about in agony and in some cases, deliberately smashing their own heads in an attempt to end the torment. Another variation involved adding turpentine or gunpowder to the pitchcap when cooled and then setting it alight.

The torture was probably devised as a response to the short "cropped" hairstyle popular in Ireland at the time (hence the nickname "croppy" given to Irish rebels), which was inspired by the French Revolutionary style which was a repudiation of the long hair and wigs of the aristocracy.

The effect on the skull of this controlled form of local boiling somewhat resembles scalping, earlier known from the North American colonies.

Pitch has long, even in antiquity, been used   like other hot liquids, even melted metal   to pour into a victim's orifices. However both those techniques were usually faster and often lethal, so less suitable as torture proper, rather as capital punishment.

Stand Up and Cheer! is a 1934 motion picture about the Depression Era in the United States, and the efforts undertaken to boost the morale of the citizenry.

The film has come under criticism in recent years due to racially offensive stereotypes used in the film. Also, it is often marketed as a Shirley Temple motion picture; in reality, the child star played a minor role in the film.

Most of the racist content has been edited out in recent versions of the film.

West Sikkim is a district of the Indian state of Sikkim. Its capital is Geyzing, also known as Gyalshing. The district is a favourite with trekkers due to the high elevations. Other important towns include Pelling and Jorethang.

The district has a wide variety of fauna and flora to offer. Since most of the district is hilly it enjoys a temperate climate. Above 3,800 m (12,000 feet) the slopes are full of rhododendron forests. 

West Sikkim also has the ancient capital of the state Yuksom. It served as the capital beginning in 1642 for almost 50 years till it was shifted to Rabtense. The district was under the occupation of the Nepalese for many decades in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. After the Gorkha War, the district was returned to Sikkim.

The economy is mainly agrarian, despite most of the land being unfit for cultivation owing to the precipitous and rocky slopes. Attractions include the Khecheoperi lake which as legend has it, not a leaf is allowed to fall on the surface of the lake and the Pemyangtse monastery, the first monastery of the state.

The people are mainly of Nepali descent. Other ethnic groups include the Lepcha and Bhutia communities. Nepali is the most widely spoken language in the district. 

The region has many power projects and enjoys almost uninterrupted electricity. Roads however, are in a poor condition owing to the frequent landslides.

"Requiem for Methuselah" is a third season episode of Star Trek: Original Series, first broadcast February 14, 1969, a St. Valentine's Day. Its repeat broadcast, on September 2, 1969, was the last official telecast of the series to air on NBC. It is episode #74, production #76, written by Jerome Bixby and directed by Murray Golden. It guest-stars James Daly as "Flint", and Louise Sorel as "Rayna Kapec" .

Overview: The crew of the Enterprise encounter an immortal human in this science fiction retelling of Shakespeare's The Tempest.

Plot.



On stardate 5843.7, the crew of the Enterprise is struck with a deadly disease known as Rigellian Fever and heads to the remote planet Holberg 917-G, in search of the mineral ryetalyn to manufacture an antidote. Once there, sensors detect humanoid life despite the reports that the planet is uninhabited.

Captain Kirk, along with his first officer Mr. Spock, and chief medical officer Dr. McCoy, beam down to the planet to investigate and are quickly attacked by a floating sentry robot. The robot is called off by its master, who steps forward and identifies himself as Flint. Flint claims that the landing party is trespassing on private property, and orders them to leave his planet immediately, threatening to kill them if they do not comply. 

Kirk, however, will not accept Flint's authority and calls Mr. Scott on the Enterprise to shoot a spread of phaser fire at their position if any harm comes to them. Such an attack would completely vaporize everything in the area. At first, Flint thinks Kirk is bluffing, but he finally backs down and reluctantly talks with his uninvited guests. McCoy informs Flint about the disease that threatens the Enterprise crew and about the urgent need for the minerals on the planet. Flint listens and compares the epidemic to bubonic plague in Constantinople, Earth in the summer of 1334. 

Flint allows the landing party two hours to gather the ryetalyn mineral and offers the services of his sentry robot, "M4", to find and gather the mineral for them. Meanwhile, Flint escorts the landing party back to his home. They are amazed at Flint's impressive collection of Earth artifacts which includes original copies of Shakespeare, a Gutenberg Bible, and lithographs by Terra Nullus of Centaurus VII. Spock is puzzled when his tricorder scans reveal the impressive works are new recreations made with contemporary materials. It is as if the original masters had returned to remake them. 

The party is then floored by the appearance of Flint's beautiful adopted daughter, Rayna, who instantly takes a liking to Spock. Spock is impressed with her incredible knowledge of advanced physics and the two discuss warp field density and its relationship to gravitational dynamics. Flint states that Rayna's parents used to be in his employ, but died in an accident. He has proudly assessed Rayna's knowledge to be the equivalent of 17 university art and science degrees.

Kirk plays billiards with Rayna, then they dance while Spock plays a waltz on the piano. Spock determines the waltz to be an unknown piece written by Johannes Brahms since the work seems to be written in his style and by his own hand. Back in Flint's lab, McCoy analyzes the ryetalyn gathered by M4 and discovers that it is contaminated with iridium, rendering it inert and useless.

Meanwhile, Kirk romances Rayna but M4 appears and attacks him. Spock enters just in time and destroys the robot with his phaser. Flint rushes in and Kirk confronts him about the attack. Flint excuses it as a simple misunderstanding, explaining M4 interpreted Kirk's advances toward Rayna as hostile. Kirk forgives the incident and is rather relieved of M4's demise, but is shocked when Flint quickly summons a replacement sentry.

Kirk contacts the Enterprise and asks Lt. Uhura to check out Flint's and Rayna's identities. She finds nothing except that Holberg 917-G was purchased 30 years ago by a private investor named Brack. In the meantime, Spock, using a surreptitious tricorder scan, discovers that Flint is over 6,000 years old. 

With the materials almost ready, Rayna comes to Kirk to say goodbye. Kirk is madly in love with her and begs her to come with him. McCoy then informs them that the ryetalyn is now missing and a search begins. Spock follows the tricorder readings to a hidden chamber where they find other Raynas, who are apparently all androids. 

Flint arrives and Kirk demands an explanation of what is going on. Flint confesses that he is immortal, born on Earth in Mesopotamia, in the year 3834 BC. He was first a soldier, and after falling in battle and later recovering, he learned he could live forever. As time went on he lived the lives of famous identities: Alexander the Great, Leonardo DaVinci, Johannes Brahms, William Shakespeare, King Solomon, Merlin, Methuselah, Reginald Pollack (of the late 20th century), the painter Sten from Marcus II, and many others throughout history. He explains his purpose for making Rayna was to create a mate who would never grow old, and live forever just as he can.  

Horrified, Kirk believes it's time to leave, but Flint refuses to let them go since they have learned his secret. He also claims that Kirk has taught Rayna something he has never been able to: true love. He now wants Kirk to direct Rayna's love toward himself. Kirk refuses to give into Flint's demands and contacts the Enterprise to beam them up and prepare to leave orbit.

Flint then activates a device that teleports the Enterprise to the planet, miniaturized to the size of a desktop model with the crew in a state of suspended animation, as seen by a giant Kirk peering through the viewscreen. Flint is quickly shamed into restoring the ship, but when he realizes Rayna will not turn her love to him, Flint attacks Kirk and a brawl ensues. Rayna tries to stop the fight and her feelings are torn in a logic loop between the two men. This causes the android's circuits to overload and she collapses dead on the floor. Flint and Kirk stop fighting and the two grief-stricken men mourn over Rayna's body.

Both men are devastated, but Flint regains his composure and allows Kirk to leave with the supply of ryetalyn. Back on the Enterprise McCoy discovers from his readings that Flint is dying. Only the complex fields of Earth were keeping him alive, but his life off world is now aging him normally. Kirk remains distraught over Rayna which is affecting his ability to command. Spock uses a Vulcan mind meld to help the captain either to forget Rayna or at least to forget the pain, uttering the word "forget." Kirk is then able to return to his duties. 



Trivia.

Methuselah is the longest-lived man mentioned in the Bible.  Genesis 5.27 reads, "And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and nine years: and he died.";

It is believed that Spock's mind-meld with Kirk to make him "forget" was the inspiration for Harve Bennett's use of the "remember" mind-meld between Spock and McCoy at the end of Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.

 Leonardo da Vinci later appeared in holographic form in the VGR episodes Scorpion, Part I and Concerning Flight.  He was referenced but not seen in that series' episodes Scorpion, Part II and Darkling.

 The prop for M4 is a differently dressed version of the prop used for the space probe Nomad in the episode "The Changeling".

 Fan critics, notably Tom Lalli in "Same Sexism, Different Generation" (Best Of Trek #15) cite this episode as exemplifying the underlying sexism in Star Trek. When the female android becomes capable of independent thought and decision-making, her circuitry overloads; she can't take it. Virtually the same thing happens to Lal in the Star Trek: The Next Generation episode "The Offspring (TNG episode)". The idea that men think and women feel is a common theme in many Star Trek scripts from all eras and incarnations of the show.

Luther J. Glenn (November 26, 1818   June 9, 1886) was a prominent Georgia lawyer, politician, Confederate officer during the American Civil War, and antebellum Mayor of Atlanta.

He was married to Mildred Lewis Cobb, a younger sister of Generals Howell and Thomas Reade Rootes Cobb (Howell Cobb later served as Governor of Georgia). Glenn represented Henry County in the state legislature as a Democrat before arriving in Atlanta in 1851. Six years later, he was elected mayor and served two consecutive one-year terms. He was the first mayor to appoint regular committees in council for the various functions of city governance: Fire, Streets, Finance, etc.

In March 1861, the Southern states that had seceded from the Union appointed special commissioners to travel to those other slaveholding Southern states that had yet to secede. Glenn served as the Commissioner from Georgia to the Missouri Secession Convention, publicly reading Georgia's Articles of Secession and trying to persuade Missouri politicians to vote to join Georgia in seceding from the Union.

During the Civil War, he served first as the company commander of C Company, Cobb's Legion (Infantry), and subsequently as Lt. Colonel of Cobb's Legion. He finished the war as the commander of the Post of Atlanta. In that position, he surrendered the remaining Confederate  troops of Atlanta to Col. Beroth B. Eggleston of the 1st Ohio Cavalry on May 3,1865.

He remained in Atlanta until his death.  He was buried in Oconee Hill Cemetery in Athens, Georgia.

Of his sons, Howell Cobb Glenn, a lawyer, died young in 1890 and John Thomas Glenn was Mayor of Atlanta in 1889.

Daniel Berrigan, S.J. (born May 9, 1921) is an internationally renowned poet, American peace activist and Roman Catholic priest. Daniel and his brother Philip performed non-violent actions against war and were for a time on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list.

History.
Daniel Berrigan was born in Virginia, Minnesota, a Midwestern working class town. His father, Thomas Berrigan, was second-generation Irish-Catholic and proud Union man. Tom left the Catholic Church, but Berrigan remained attracted to the Church throughout his youth. He joined the Jesuits directly out of high school in 1939 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1952. He now resides in New York City and serves as the Fordham University poet in residence.

Berrigan appears briefly in the 1986 film, The Mission, directed by Roland Joffé and starring Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons. He plays a Jesuit priest and also served as a consultant on the film.

Protests against the War in Vietnam.
Berrigan, his brother Philip, and the famed Trappist monk Thomas Merton founded an interfaith coalition against the Vietnam War, and wrote letters to major newspapers arguing for an end to the war. 

In 1969, Philip Berrigan was arrested for non-violent protest and sentenced to six years in prison. Afterwards, Daniel Berrigan seriously considered taking more direct action against the war. Howard Zinn, professor emeritus at Boston University, invited Berrigan to accompany him on a trip to Hanoi to negotiate the release of three U.S. pilots held prisoner by the North Vietnamese. Although the mission had a high chance of success, it was opposed by the FBI on the grounds that it violated their policy of non-negotiation with North Vietnam. J. Edgar Hoover went so far as to publicly call Zinn and Berrigan "traitors". U.S. planes even bombed locations where they were scheduled to be. Despite the opposition, three pilots were returned home. They were the first American POWs released unharmed by the North Vietnamese. The lack of acknowledgement and appreciation by the U.S. government helped to radicalize Berrigan.

In 1969, Berrigan decided to participate in a more radical non-violent protest. A local high-school physics teacher helped to concoct homemade napalm. Nine activists, who later became known as the Catonsville Nine, walked into the draft board of Catonsville, Maryland, and removed 378 draft files, which they brought outside and burned. The Catonsville Nine, who were all Catholic, issued a statement:
"We confront the Catholic Church, other Christian bodies, and the synagogues of America with their silence and cowardice in the face of our country's crimes. We are convinced that the religious bureaucracy in this country is racist, is an accomplice in this war, and is hostile to the poor."

Berrigan was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison, but he refused to serve his time. Instead, he went underground, living discreetly among like-minded individuals. The FBI, to its great embarrassment, was not immediately able to apprehend Berrigan, although he frequently showed up briefly at public events, made impromptu speeches, and went back into hiding. During this time Berrigan was also interviewed for a documentary titled "The Holy Outlaw," by Lee Lockwood. 

Eventually, the FBI managed to find and arrest Berrigan. He was released from prison in 1972.  After his release from prison, Berrigan spent time in France meeting with Thich Nhat Hanh, the exiled Buddhist monk peace activist from Vietnam.

He is interviewed in the 1968 anti-Vietnam War documentary film In the Year of the Pig.

The Plowshares Movement .
On September 9, 1980, Berrigan, his brother Philip, and six others (the "Plowshares Eight") began the Plowshares Movement when they entered the General Electric Nuclear Missile Re-entry Division in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania where nose cones for the Mark 12A warheads were made. They hammered on two nose cones, poured blood on documents and offered prayers for peace. They were arrested and initially charged with over ten different felony and misdemeanor counts. On April 10 1990, after nearly ten years of trials and appeals, the Plowshares Eight were re-sentenced and paroled for up to 23 and 1/2 months in consideration of time already served in prison. Their legal battle was dramatically re-created in Emile de Antonio's 1982 film In The King of Prussia, which starred Martin Sheen and featured appearances by the Plowshares Eight as themselves. 

Since this action over seventy Plowshares actions have taken place around the world against weapons of war, several involving Berrigan himself.

Among the Plowshares Eight was Father Carl Kabat, 72, a fellow Roman-Catholic priest who is currently in prison. Kabat is the subject of the original play And Carl Laughed, written by two teachers at Clayton High School, in Clayton, MO. The play will debut this summer, performed by students from the school, at the 2007 Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

Other activism.
Berrigan has spoken out on many issues since then, and has been involved in many protests. He has led protests against American destabilization of Central America, the 1991 Gulf War, the Kosovo War, the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He is also a prominent pro-life activist. He had been a guest speaker at Regis High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school in Manhattan.

UMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) is the brand name for the project within 3GPP2 to improve the CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications and requirements. The system employs OFDMA technology along with advanced antenna techniques to provide peak rates of up to 280Mbps. Goals for UMB include significantly improving system capacity, greatly increasing user data rates throughout the cell, lowering costs, enhancing existing services, making possible new applications, and making use of new spectrum opportunities. The technology will provide users with concurrent IP-based services in a full mobility environment. The UMB standardization is expected to be completed in mid 2007, with commercialization taking place around mid-2009. 

To provide ubiquitous and universal access, UMB supports inter-technology handoffs with other  technologies including existing CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO systems.

The name Ultra Mobile Broadband communicates the key attributes of the technology: 

Ultra:  An ultra fast technology that supports more than an order of magnitude increase in broadband data throughput rates to economically deliver IP-based voice, multimedia, broadband, information technology, entertainment, and consumer electronic services within most kind of devices

Mobile:  A platform that supports several wireless services within a full mobility environment and thus differentiates itself from Wi-Fi, WiMAX, UWB, etc

Broadband:  Ultra high-speeds that are in the order of 100s of megabits per second; next-generation capabilities, beyond 3G

 UMB Summary .
OFDMA-based air interface;
Frequency Division Duplex;
Scalable bandwidth between 1.25-20 MHz (OFDMA systems are especially well suited for wider bandwidths larger than 5MHz);
Supports mixed cell sizes, e.g., macro-cellular, micro-cellular & pico-cellular.
IP network architecture;
Supports flat, centralized and mixed topologies;


 UMB Key Design Elements . 
Significantly higher data rates & reduced latencies using FL advanced antenna techniques;
MIMO, SDMA and Beamforming;
Higher RL sector capacity with quasi-orthogonal reverse link	;
Increased cell edge user data rates using adaptive interference management;
Dynamic fractional frequency reuse;
Distributed RL power control based on other cell interference;
Real time services enabled by fast seamless L1/L2 handoffs ;
Independent RL & FL handoffs provide better airlink and handoff performance;
Power optimization through use of quick paging and semi-connected state;
Low-overhead signaling using flexible airlink resource management;
Fast access and request using RL CDMA control channels;
New scalable IP architecture supports inter-technology handoffs;
New handoff mechanisms support real-time services throughout the network and across different airlink technologies;
Fast acquisition and efficient multi-carrier operation through use of beacons ;
Multi-carrier configuration supports incremental deployment & mix of low-complexity & wideband devices;

UMB Benefits.

UMB is intended to be a so-called fourth-generation technology. These technologies use an high bandwidth, low latency, underlying TCP/IP network with high level services such as voice built on top. While no 4G networks have been deployed yet, the much greater amount of bandwidth, and much lower latencies, should enable the use of various application types that have previously been impossible, while continuing to deliver high quality (or higher quality) voice services. The improved bandwidths of the network provided by more efficient technologies may also result in networks with better capacity.

UMB's use of OFDMA eliminates many of the disadvantages of the CDMA technology used by its predecessor, including the "breathing" phenomenon, the difficulty of adding capacity via microcells, and the fixed bandwidth sizes that limit the total bandwidth available to handsets.

<doc id="1627233" title="Baron Sigmund Zois von Edelstein" nonfiltered="203" processed="201" dbindex="1480203">

Sigmund Zois (Žiga Zois) (23 November 1747 in Trieste - 10 November 1819 in Ljubljana) studied natural sciences with Gabriel Gruber and Joseph Maffei in Ljubljana. 

Sigmund was born in Ljubljana (capital of present Slovenia) in 1747.

Sigmund's father, Michelangelo Zois was a Venitian salesman who moved to Ljubljana where he made a considerable fortune. He married a Slovenian noblewoman and acquired the right to the title of baron.

After attending several private schools, Sigmund Zois moved to Italy where he continued his education. He enjoyed traveling and getting acquainted to new people. However, his way of life was soon truncated by gout, a disease that would stuck him for the rest of his life. After returning to Ljubljana, he developed a strong interest in sciences and worked with Baltazar Hacquet and other Slovenian intellectuals. 

In 1780, his house in Ljubljana became a fostering center for liberal intellectuals at the center of the Slovenian enlightenment. Jurij Japelj, Blaž Kumerdej, Jernej Kopitar, Anton Tomaž Linhart, Valentin Vodnik were all members of the  Zois circle . 

Zois was their mecenate (patron), he mentored them and granted financial support, and becamethe central figure of the Slovenian enlightenment. He was a deist and his views were rational and empirical. Nevertheless, he strongly disagreed with the French revolution.

Literary work by Sigmund Zois includes many literary forms and genres, ranging from arias for the opera to lyrics for folk music, although probably only a minor part of his work has been preserved. His translation of the poem Lorelei by Gottfried August Burger was regarded as a complete failure, and Zois himself later came to believe that the Slovenian language was too mediocre and rough to allow for such a literary achievement. He would be disproven only some decades later by France Prešeren who managed to compose a complex and exceptional translation of the same poem. Zois is also regarded as a father of Slovenian literary criticism, most of his literary reviews can be found in his correspondence with Valentin Vodnik.

He worked in mineralogy, geology, botany and zoology. His collection of minerals (around 5,000 items) is kept in a museum in Ljubljana.

In 1795 he mounted two expeditions to explore the land around the Triglav mountain. In 1805 a mineral zoisite was named after him, since Zois correctly judged that the finding of Simon Presern in the Alps in Carinthia represented an unknown mineral.

Sigmund also helped his brother, a botanist Karl Zois, the discoverer of Campanula zoysii. The main award for science and also a state scholarship for talented students in Slovenia is named after Žiga Zois.

<doc id="1450863" title="Early Muslim sociology" nonfiltered="207" processed="205" dbindex="1480207">
Early Muslim sociology responded to the challenges of social organization of diverse peoples all under common religious organization in the Islamic caliphate, the Abbasid and later Mamluk period in Egypt. It was rooted in methods from early Muslim philosophy and it reflected the strong concern of Islam with social cohesion.

 Social responsibility in commerce .
The development of Islamic banks and Islamic economics was a side effect of this sociology: usury was rather severely restrained, no interest rate was allowed, and investors were not permitted to escape the consequences of any failed venture - all financing was equity financing (Musharaka). In not letting borrowers bear all the risk/cost of a failure, an extreme disparity of outcomes between "partners" is thus avoided. Ultimately this serves a social harmony purpose.

Muslims also could not and cannot (in shariah) finance any dealings in forbidden goods or activities e.g. alcohols, pork, gambling etc. Thus ethical investing is the only acceptable investing, and moral purchasing is encouraged.

 Ecological responsibility .
Perhaps due to resource scarcity in most Islamic nations, there was an emphasis on limited (and some claim also sustainable) use of natural capital, i.e. producing land. Traditions of haram and hima and early urban planning were expressions of strong social obligations to stay within carrying capacity and to preserve the natural environment as an obligation of khalifa or "stewardship".

 Khaldun's conflict theory .
Without doubt the most important figure in early Muslim sociology was Ibn Khaldun, who conceived both a central social conflict ("town" versus "desert") as well as a theory (using the concept of a "generation") of the necessary loss of power of city conquerors coming from the desert.

Sati' al-Husri suggested that his Muqaddimah is essentially a sociological work, sketching over its six books a general sociology; a sociology of politics; a sociology of urban life; a sociology of economics; and a sociology of knowledge.

 Asibiyah .
Khaldun's central concept of asabiyah, or "social cohesion," seems to anticipate modern conceptions of social capital arising in social networks:

This cohesion arises spontaneously in tribes and other small kinship groups; and it can be intensified and enlarged by a religious ideology. Khaldun's analysis looks at how this cohesion carries groups to power but contains within itself the seeds - psychological, sociological, economic, political - of the group's downfall, to be replaced by a new group, dynasty or empire bound by a stronger (or at least younger and more vigorous) cohesion.

Interestingly, Khaldun's concept is instinctive and does not involve any social contract or explicit forms of constitution or other instructional capital that would provide a basis for appeals, in law or otherwise.

 Khaldun's economics .
A similar dialectic approach was taken to describe the sociological implications of tax choices, which is now of course part of economics:

"In the early stages of the state, taxes are light in their incidence, but fetch in a large revenue...As time passes and kings succeed each other, they lose their tribal habits in favor of more civilized ones. Their needs and exigencies grow...owing to the luxury in which they have been brought up. Hence they impose fresh taxes on their subjects...and sharply raise the rate of old taxes to increase their yield...But the effects on business of this rise in taxation make themselves felt. For business men are soon discouraged by the comparison of their profits with the burden of their taxes...Consequently production falls off, and with it the yield of taxation."

This analysis anticipates the modern economic concept known as the Laffer Curve.

 Khaldun's history .
The Muqaddimah further emphasized the role of systemic bias in affecting the standard of evidence. Khaldun was quite concerned with the effect of raising standard of evidence when confronted with uncomfortable claims, and relaxing it when given claims that seemed reasonable or comfortable. He was a jurist, and sometimes participated reluctantly in rulings that he felt were coerced, based on arguments he didn't respect.

Khaldun had few successors in his thinking about history until Arnold J. Toynbee, a 20th century British historian.

 Similarity to modern sociology .
Early Muslim sociology is more like that of Hegel or Marx in emphasizing dialectic or feedback loops, or like systems theory as applied in such fields as corporate social responsibility, than it is like that of Weber and others who emphasize structures. There is a remarkable similarity between modern economic ideas and the sociology and economics especially of Khaldun, who lived a remarkably eventful life.

The Icarians were a French utopian movement, founded by Étienne Cabet.

American Settlement.

In 1848, a group of 1500 Icarians, followers of Cabet's books and principles, joined Cabet at Le Havre, France, to settle in the United States. They landed at New Orleans and settled near Fort Worth, Texas. They came to America to establish a communal settlement based on Cabet's ideas, and in the early 1850s they came at this time to occupy the community at Nauvoo, Illinois formerly inhabited by the Mormons. They chose Nauvoo because it was built for communal living and dining, In the 1850s, political disagreements divided the Icarians. Cabet himself and some followers went to St. Louis, but most of the community moved west to Corning, Iowa to establish a colony of "New Icaria". The colony at Corning was granted a charter of incorporation by the state of Iowa in 1860. This group officially disbanded in 1878. A new colony was established in California, but it also disbanded by 1886. A related group in Iowa continued to stay together, but they too finally disbanded in 1898.

Communal Living.

The Icarians (in German, Ikariens) lived in communal dwellings of dormitories that shared central living and dining areas. Children were raised in a community creche, not just by their own parents. Tasks were divided among the group; one might be a seamstress and never need to cook.

Political Context.

Cabet was strongly influenced by events of the Revolution of 1830, in which a democratic uprising forced the restored French monarchy to grant a new constitution respecting civil rights. These rights were diminished over time, and Cabet wrote a utopian work about an ideal society. When the Revolution of 1848 established the Second Republic, it became clear that Cabet's utopian ideals could not be implemented with all the baggage of French history, so he struck out for America to start a new society from a completely blank slate. 

Victor Hugo's Les Misérables describes the events of 1848. Karl Marx's vision of a perfect worker's utopia was strongly influenced by both Cabet's idealism and by the proof of it as a working reality in Illinois and Iowa.

The Minor Counties play three-day matches at a level below that of the first-class game.  At present, Dorset competes in the Western Division of the Minor Counties Championship.

Honours.
 Minor Counties Championship (1) - 2000;
 MCCA Knockout Trophy (1) - 1988;

Earliest cricket.
Cricket must have reached Dorset via neighbouring Hampshire by the end of the 17th century.

An advertisement in the Sherborne Mercury dated Tuesday 9 May 1738 is the earliest reference for cricket in Dorset.  Twelve Dorchester men at Ridgway Races challenged twelve men from elsewhere to play them at cricket for the prize of twelve pairs of gloves valued at a shilling a pair.

Origin of club.
According to Wisden there was county organisation in existence in either 1862 or 1871.  The present Dorset CCC was founded on 5 February 1896 and first entered the Minor Counties Championship in 1902.

Club history.

Dorset has won the Minor Counties Championship once, in 2000. 

Dorset has won the MCCA Knockout Trophy once since its inception in 1983. It won in 1988.

<doc id="8398201" title="Tanapox" nonfiltered="215" processed="213" dbindex="1480215">
Tanapox (a virus from the genus Yatapoxvirus), was first seen among individuals in the flood plain of the Tana River in Kenya during two epidemics (1957 and 1962) of acute febrile illness accompanied by localized skin lesions.


 Epidemiology .
Human tanapox has been mostly documented in Kenya and Zaire, but it is believed to occur much more widely throughout tropical Africa. All age groups and both sexes appear to be affected by this virus. During the Kenyan epidemics of 1957 and 1962, cases of tanapox were reported more frequently among persons who worked or played close to the river. As a result of this, researchers concluded that tanapox is most likely a zoonosis. However, neither the reservoir host nor the mode of transmission from wild animal to human is know. It is hypothesized that tanapox virus may be transferred from monkeys or another reservoir host to humans by infected arthropods that act as mechanical vectors. Only one case of human to human transmission has been reported.

 Incubation Period .
The incubation period in human cases is unknown, but in a person who underwent voluntary inoculation, erythema and central thickening appeared by the fourth day following infection.

 Symptomatology and Outcomes .
Most patients present a mild preeruptive fever that lasts 3-4 days, severe headaches and backaches, and often itching at the site where the skin lesion develops.

There is initially a small nodule, without any central abrasion. This small nodule soon becomes papular and gradually enlarges to reach a maximum diameter of about 15 mm by the end of the second week of infection. The draining nymph nodes are also enlarged and tender from about the fifth day following the appearance of the skin lesion. The lesion remains mostly nodular but, ulcerates during the third week and then gradually heals within 5 to 6 weeks, leaving a scar.

In Kenya, the lesions were almost always solitary and were found on the upper arm, face, neck, and truck. Conversely, in Zaire, 22% of patients had multiple lesions, usually two or three. The maximum number of lesions seen in one patient was ten. In the case of Zairian patients, the lesions were mostly found on the lower limbs, with a couple of patients reporting lesions on the upper limbs, trunk, and head.

 Pathology and Pathogenesis .
Tanapox virus in humans produces increased thickening of the epidermis with extensive, degeneration of the prickle cell layer. The cytoplasm of the swollen epidermal cells is filled with large, pleomorphic, eosinophilic B-type inclusion bodies. Nuclei of infected cells are also swollen, with chromatin being concentrated at the nuclear periphery.

To encourage and assist each student to achieve and enjoy their academic, physical, social and spiritual potential. This aligns with the school's vision which is Caring for their tomorrow - today.

 History .
The school was established on former farm land which was gifted to the local church for the establishment of the school. Local church member, Kevin Chugg built two classrooms at a total cost of $16,000.

The School buildings have also changed over time. As early as 1995 the school only had two building, the white building at the top of the school (which is due to be knocked down and a new set of classrooms built in a matter of months) and the old Primary school rooms (which are being knocked down in a matter of weeks, but since then has had major redevelopments done to it, and will continue to do so.

 Extra-curricular Activities .
Primary school students are encouraged to set their minds to work, including learning to play games such as chess.

The high school also has a choir called "Zealos". Led by two of the schools teachers, this chior has been on tours of Queensland and Northern New South Wales as well as Victoria, and have even recorded there own album entitled "Better Way" which was put together entirely by the students.

Joanne P. McCallie, 38 years old, of Brunswick, Maine, is the head coach of the Michigan State University women's basketball team, where she has been since 2000.

McCallie, who was named to the position on March 27, 2000, became just the fourth head coach in Michigan State women's basketball history. She replaced Karen Langeland, who retired following 24 years as the head coach at MSU.

McCallie arrived at MSU after spending eight years as the head coach at the University of Maine. During her tenure with the Black Bears, McCallie guided Maine to a record of 167-73, six-straight NCAA Tournament appearances, two North Atlantic Conference Championships, two America East Conference Championships and five regular-season conference titles.

McCallie guided the Black Bears to seven-straight 20-win campaigns, including a 20-11 overall record in 1999-2000 and their sixth-straight NCAA Tournament appearance. She was named conference coach of the year three times, twice in the North Atlantic Conference (1995 and 1996) and once in the America East (1999).

Prior to taking her first head coaching position, McCallie was an assistant coach at Auburn University from 1988-92. As the team's primary recruiter, she helped sign the fourth-ranked class in the nation in 1990-91 and the 16th-ranked class in 1991-92. While at Auburn, McCallie and the Tigers appeared in two national championship games and made an appearance in the NCAA Elite Eight. 

No stranger to the Big Ten, McCallie, then Palombo, played her collegiate basketball at Northwestern University from 1984-87. She still ranks seventh in Wildcat history with 378 career assists. As a senior, she was an All-Big Ten honorable mention selection and helped lead the Wildcats to the second round of the NCAA Tournament. McCallie also was named Academic All-Big Ten First-Team as a senior.

McCallie graduated from Northwestern in 1987 with a degree in political science and earned a master's degree in business administration from Auburn in 1990. 

Coach P (Palombo), as she is known by her players, is an active speaker within the community and for women's athletics. At MSU, McCallie created the "Choice Not Chance" philosophy, which focuses on making the correct choices in life. The philosophy has been widely used by McCallie, her staff and players, who have been very active in the area schools speaking about "CNC". 

In addition, McCallie's community service includes working with the Big Brothers and Big Sisters "Jump" program; serving as the Honorary Chair for the Haven House -- a shelter for homeless families in East Lansing, Michigan; serving as the Honorary Chair for the 2001 Crop Walk and the 2001-04 Memory Walks for Alzheimer's; and holding the Joanne P. McCallie Golf Challenge benefitting children and adolescents with cancer. 

While at Maine, she organized an event called "Realizing the Dream; Celebrating Women in Athletics" that featured speakers Dr. Donna Lopiano and Sheryl Swoopes. During the 1997-98 season, Dana Rae Warren filmed a documentary of the Maine women's basketball season. She was inducted into the New England Basketball Hall of Fame in 2004. 

McCallie was named a conference captain by the Women's Basketball Coaches Association in 2002. 

Joanne and her husband, John McCallie, Ph.D., have a 10-year-old daughter, Madeline (Maddie), and a 4-year-old son, John Wyatt (Jack).

<doc id="260084" title="East Hampton (village), New York" nonfiltered="220" processed="218" dbindex="1480220">

East Hampton is a village in Suffolk County, New York on the South Shore of Long Island. As of the United States 2000 Census, the village population was 1,334.

The Village of East Hampton is a wealthy community on the southern coast of Long Island, New York, known for its green farmland next to scenic beaches, and its many famous residents. The village is a small, more exclusive area of the Town of East Hampton.

 History .
Founded in 1648 by English farmers, East Hampton remained a quiet farming community until the late 1800s, when it began to develop as a resort for the wealthy upper class from New York City. It has become a major weekend destination for New York City residents during the summer. The area around East Hampton is also referred to colloquially as "The Hamptons."

 Famous Natives .
Howard Dean;

Beaches.
East Hampton's Main Beach consistently ranks as one of America's Top Ten beaches as ranked by "Dr. Beach" Stephen B. Leatherman.

Parking access to the Atlantic Ocean beaches within the incorporated village of East Hampton is severely restricted  from May 1 to September 30.  In 2006 there were only 2,600 permits available for non-residents with a charge of $250.  Residents can always get parking permits.  

East Hampton's beaches are considered very desirable because of their clean white sands, the fact they are relatively accessible, and connected to the main land (rather than being on a barrier island) and because there is a minimum of development adjoining the beach.  None of the village beaches have an abundance of parking and this limits the crowd size.  There is no restriction preventing people from arriving at the beaches via bike, foot or being dropped off.  Severe restrictions on neighborhood streets surrounding the beaches prohibit parking.  

The beaches of East Hampton village (from west to east):

Georgica - This beach adjoining Georgica Pond is popular with surfers because of currents arounds its controversial groynes.  The beach has bathroom facilities.
Main Beach - The beach is the only one with a pavillion where you can get food and also has a limited number of lockers available to residents.
Wiborg Beach - Has a parking lot, and is right next to Maidstone Club. It does not have a lifeguard. In the summer of 2006 it played host to the "hot" surf spot to be at. ;
Egypt Lane Beach - This beach is sometimes called Maidstone Beach because of its close proximity to the headquarters of the Maidstone Golf Club.  However this is inaccurate since there is a Maidstone Beach on the bay in an unincorporated area of East Hampton.  Main, Wiborg and Egypt Lane are immediately next to the Maidstone Golf Club course.
Two Mile Hollow - This beach has the second largest parking lot of the village beaches.  ;

In addition to the village beaches there are beaches in unincorporated East Hampton (town), New York in the hamlets of Wainscott, Amagansett, Napeauge and Montauk.

There are also an assortment of beaches on Long Island Sound and its bays on the north side of the town running the length of the town.

<doc id="23964" title="PlayStation" nonfiltered="221" processed="219" dbindex="1480221">






The  is a video game console of the fifth generation, first produced by Sony Computer Entertainment in the mid-1990s. The original PlayStation was the first of the notorious PlayStation series of console and hand-held game devices, which has included successor machines including the Net Yaroze, PSone (a smaller version of the original), PocketStation, PlayStation 2, a revised, slimline PS2, PlayStation Portable, PSX (Japan only), and PlayStation 3. 
By March 2005, the PlayStation/PSone had shipped a total of over 100.49 million units, becoming the first home console to ever reach the 100 million mark.

 History .


The first conceptions of the PlayStation date back to 1986. Nintendo had been attempting to work with disk technology since the Famicom, but the medium had problems. Its rewritable magnetic nature could be easily erased (thus leading to a lack of durability), and the disks were a piracy danger. Consequently, when details of CDROM/XA (an extension of the CD-ROM format that combines compressed audio, visual and computer data, allowing all to be accessed simultaneously) came out, Nintendo was interested. CDROM/XA was being simultaneously developed by Sony and Philips. Nintendo approached Sony to develop a CD-ROM add-on, tentatively titled the "SNES-CD". A contract was struck, and work began. Nintendo's choice of Sony was due to a prior dealing: Ken Kutaragi, the person who would later be dubbed "The Father of PlayStation," was the individual who had sold Nintendo on using the Sony SPC-700 processor for use as the 8 channel ADPCM sound synthesis set in the Super Famicom/SNES console through an impressive demonstration of the processor's capabilities. 

Sony also planned to develop another, Nintendo compatible, Sony-branded console, but one which would be more of a home entertainment system playing both Super Nintendo cartridges and a new CD format which Sony would design.  This was also to be the format used in SNES-CD discs, giving a large degree of control to Sony despite Nintendo's leading position in the video gaming market.

In 1989, the SNES-CD was to be announced at the June CES . However, when Hiroshi Yamauchi read the original 1988 contract between Sony and Nintendo, he realized that the earlier agreement essentially handed Sony complete control over any and all titles written on the SNESCD-ROM format. Yamauchi was furious; deeming the contract totally unacceptable, he secretly cancelled all plans for the joint Nintendo-Sony SNES CD attachment. Indeed, instead of announcing their partnership, at 9 am the day of the CES, Nintendo chairman Howard Lincoln stepped onto the stage and revealed that they were now allied with Philips, and were planning on abandoning all the previous work Nintendo and Sony had accomplished. Lincoln and Minoru Arakawa had, unbeknownst to Sony, flown to Philips headquarters in Europe and formed an alliance of a decidedly different nature   one that would give Nintendo total control over its licenses on Philips machines.

The 9am CES announcement was a complete shock. Not only was it a complete surprise to the show goers (Sony had only just the previous night been optimistically showing off the joint project under the "Play Station" brand), but it was seen by many in the Japanese business community as a massive betrayal: a Japanese company snubbing another Japan-based company in favor of a European one was considered absolutely unthinkable in Japanese business.

After the collapse of the joint project, Sony considered halting their research, but ultimately the company decided to use what they had developed so far and make it into a complete, stand alone console. This led to Nintendo filing a lawsuit claiming breach of contract and attempted, in U.S. federal court, to obtain an injunction against the release of the Play Station, on the grounds that Nintendo owned the name. The federal judge presiding over the case denied the injunction. Thus, in October 1991, the first incarnation of the new Sony PlayStation was revealed; it is theorized that only 200 or so of these machines were ever produced.

By the end of 1992, Sony and Nintendo reached a deal whereby the "Sony Play Station" would still have a port for SNES games, but Nintendo would own the rights and receive the bulk of the profits from the games, and the SNES would continue to use the Sony-designed audio chip.  However, at this point, Sony realized that the SNES technology was getting long in the tooth, and the next generation of console gaming was around the corner: work began in early 1993 on reworking the "Play Station" concept to target a new generation of hardware and software; as part of this process the SNES cartridge port was dropped, the space between the names was removed, and the PlayStation was born.

Launch.
The PlayStation was launched in Japan on December 3 1994, the United States on September 9 1995, Europe on September 29 1995 and Asia-Pacific in November 1995.  In America, Sony enjoyed a very successful launch with titles of almost every genre including Battle Arena Toshinden, Twisted Metal, Warhawk, Philosoma, and Ridge Racer.  Almost all of Sony's and Namco's launch titles went on to produce numerous sequels.

Launch price in the American market: US$ 299.00 , a price point later used by its successor, the PlayStation 2.

The PlayStation was also able to generate interest with a unique slew of ad campaigns.  Many of the ads released at the time of launch were full of ambiguous content which had many gamers rabidly debating their meanings.  The most well-known launch ads include the "Enos Lives" campaign, and the "U R Not e" ads (the "e" in "U R Not e" was always colored in red, to symbolize the word "ready", and the "Enos" meant "ready Ninth Of September", the U.S. launch date). The Enos ad could also be read as Sony written backward with phonetic sound of "E" replacing the "y". It is believed that these ads were an attempt to play off the gaming public's suspicion towards Sony as an unknown, untested entity in the video game market. The PlayStation 3 slogan, "PLAY B3YOND", resembles this slogan, as the 3 is red.

Titles.
Well known titles on the  PlayStation include , Crash Bandicoot, Final Fantasy VII, Gran Turismo, Grand Theft Auto, Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver , Metal Gear Solid, Parasite Eve, Resident Evil, Silent Hill, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Spyro The Dragon, Tekken, Tomb Raider, and Wipeout . The very last game for the system was FIFA Football 2005.  As of May 18 2004, Sony has shipped 100 million PlayStation and PSone consoles throughout the world. As of September 2006, 7,902 software titles have been released worldwide (counting games released in multiple regions as separate titles) with cumulative software shipment of 961 million units. The PlayStation logo was designed by Manabu Sakamoto, who also designed the logo for Sony's VAIO computer products.

Production run.
Having lasted over 11 years, the PlayStation has enjoyed one of the longest production runs in the videogame industry. On March 23, 2006, Sony announced the end of production. 

Variants.
The first new version was actually a revision in early 1996, produced in response to complaints that PlayStations were overheating. Sony did not change the technical aspects or the cosmetics but did remove the RCA ports left over from the Japanese release. The parallel port (which was mostly unused by Sony) was also removed to reduce production costs. Sony also slightly improved the laser assembly. 

Many gamers experienced skipping full-motion video or dreaded physical "ticking" noises coming from their PlayStations.  The problem appears to have come from poorly placed vents leading to overheating in some environments   the plastic moldings inside the console would warp very slightly and create knock-on effects with the laser assembly.  The solution was to ensure the console was sat on a surface which dissipated heat efficiently in a well vented area, or raise the unit up slightly by propping something at its edges.  A common fix for already affected consoles was to turn the PlayStation sideways or upside-down (thereby using gravity to cancel the effects of the warped interior) although some gamers smacked the lid of the PlayStation to make a game load or work. 

Sony then released a version dubbed "Dual Shock", which included a controller with 2 analog thumbsticks and a built in force-feedback feature.

Another version that was colored blue (as opposed to regular console units that were grey in color) was available to game developers and select press. Later versions of this were colored green - on a technical level, these units were almost identical to the retail units, but had a different CD controller in them that did not require the region code found on all pressed disks, since they were intended to be used with CD-R media for debugging - this also allowed the use of discs from different regions, but this was not officially supported, and different debug stations existed for each region.  The two different color cases were not cosmetic - the original blue debug station (DTL-H100x, DTL-H110x) contained "Revision B" silicon, the same as the early retail units (these units had silicon errata that needed software workarounds), the green units (DTL-H120x) had Rev. C hardware. As part of the required tests, you had to test your title on both. Contrary to popular belief, the RAM was the same as the retail units at 2MB.  The firmware was nearly identical - the only significant change was that debug printf()s got sent to the serial port if the title didn't open it for communications - this used a DTL-H3050 serial cable (the same as the one used for the Yaroze).

A number of these units appeared on the secondary market (at generally high prices), and were popular because they would run games from any region and CD-R copies, which tended to result them in commanding high prices.  All the blue units tend to have CD problems, but the DTL-H110x units (with an external PSU block) are significantly more reliable than the original DTL-H100x ones.

A white version was also produced that had the ability to play VCDs - this was only sold in Asia, since that format never really caught on anywere else. From a developer perspective, the white PSX could be treated exactly like any other NTSC:J PlayStation.
 
The installation of a modchip allowed the PlayStation's capabilities to be expanded, and several options were made available. By the end of the system's life cycle almost anyone with minimal soldering experience was able to realize the modification of the console. Such a modification allowed the playing of games from other regions, such as PAL titles on a NTSC console, or allowed the ability to play illicit copies of original games without restriction. Modchips allows the playing of games recorded on a regular CD-ROM. This created a wave of games developed without official approval using free GNU compiler tools, as well as the illegal reproduction of original discs. With the introduction of such devices the console was very attractive to Programmers and Pirates alike. 

Individuals that insisted on creating copies of games that would play as their original counterparts faced many issues at the time, as the discs that were produced by Sony were designed to be difficult to copy - and impossible to copy on recordable media. Not only did the original discs have a specific black tint to them, they were mastered with a specific wobble in the leadin - when amplified and sliced this contained a 4 character sequence that was checked by the CD-ROM drives mechacon chip, and the drive would only accept the disk if it was correct (this string varied depending on the region of the disk - "SCEI" for NTSC:J machines, "SCEA" for NTSC:U/C machines, "SCEE" for PAL machines and "SCEW" for the Net Yaroze). Since the tracking pattern is pressed into the disc at the time of manufacture and CD-Rs have a clean spiral, this cannot be reproduced on a CD-ROM recorder.  Some companies (notably Datel) did manage to produce discs that booted on unmodifed retail units, but this was beyond the average pirate.  The other issue was that most PC drives used Mode 1 or Mode 2/Form 1 (2048 bytes/sector) and the PSX used a mixed-mode format with most data in Mode 2/Form 1 and streaming audio/video data in Mode 2/Form 2 - which a lot CD-R drives at the time could not handle well. Even after accurate copies were made, you still needed a modchip to send the correct code to the CD controller to enable the disc to be read (if a disk failed the security checks, it could be played as an audio CD, but the CD controller would reject any attempt at data transfers from it).

The creation and mass-production of these inexpensive modchips, coupled with their ease of installation, truly marked the beginning of console videogame piracy. Coincidentally, CD-ROM burners were made available around this time. Before this, the reproduction of copyrighted material for gaming consoles was restricted to either A.) People with exceptional ability, or B.) Access to very serious plastics manufacturing plants. With this console, Joe Public could replicate anything Sony was producing for a mere fraction of the MSRP.

Net Yaroze.
A version of the PlayStation called the Net Yaroze was also produced. It was more expensive than the original PlayStation, colored black instead of the usual gray, and most importantly, came with tools and instructions that allowed a user to be able to program PlayStation games and applications without the need for a full developer suite, which cost many times the amount of a PlayStation and was only available to approved video game developers. Naturally, the Net Yaroze lacked many of the features the full developer suite provided. Programmers were also limited by the 2 MB of total game space that Net Yaroze allowed. That means the entire game had to be crammed into the 2 MB of system RAM. The user couldn't officially make actual game discs. The amount of space may seem small, but games like Ridge Racer ran entirely from the system RAM (except for the streamed music tracks). It was unique in that it was the only officially retailed Sony PlayStation with no regional lockout; it would play games from any territory.



PSone.
The PSone (also PSOne, PS one, or PS1), launched in 2000, is Sony's smaller (and redesigned) version of its PlayStation video game console. The PSone is about one-third smaller than the original PlayStation (38mm × 193 mm × 144 mm versus 45 mm × 260 mm × 185 mm). It was released in July 7, 2000, and went on to outsell all other consoles including Sony's own brand-new PlayStation 2 throughout the remainder of the year. Sony also released a small LCD screen and an adaptor to power the unit for use in cars. The PSone is fully compatible with all PlayStation software. The PlayStation is now officially abbreviated as the "PS1" or "PSone," although many people still abbreviate it "PS" or "PSX". There were three differences between the "PSone" and the original, the first one being cosmetic change to the console, the second one was the home menu's Graphical User Interface, and the third being added protection against the mod-chip by changing the internal layout and making previous-generation mod-chip devices unusable.  The PSone also lacks the original PlayStation's serial port, which allowed multiple consoles to be hooked up for multi-TV multiplayer. The serial port could also be used for an external mod-chip, which may have been why it was removed, although size-constraints may also be to blame.

Trivia.
The OK and Cancel buttons on most of the Japanese PlayStation's games are reversed in their American and European releases. In Japan, the Circle button (maru, right) is universally used as the OK button, while the X button (batsu, wrong) is used as the Cancel one. American and European releases have the X button as the OK button, while the Circle or the Triangle buttons are used as the Cancel ones. However, a few games such as Squaresoft's Vagrant Story, Final Fantasy VII, and Final Fantasy Tactics, and Konami's Metal Gear Solid, have the buttons remain in the same Japanese configuration in their American and European releases. These Japanese button layouts still apply to newer PlayStation consoles, such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP) and PlayStation 2.

Successors.



Sony's successor to the PlayStation is the PlayStation 2, which is backward compatible with its predecessor, in the sense that it can play almost every PlayStation game. This was done by embedding the most important parts of the PSone inside the PlayStation 2 design. Unlike emulators that run on the PC, the PlayStation 2 actually contains the original PlayStation processor, allowing games to run exactly as they do on the PlayStation. For PlayStation 2 games this processor, called the IOP, is used for input and output (memory cards, DVD drive, network, and hard drive). Like its predecessor, the PlayStation 2 is based on hardware developed by Sony themselves.

The next generation of the PlayStation is known as PlayStation 3, or PS3, and has been launched in November 2006 for North America and Japan, and will be launched on the 23rd March 2007 in Europe. Sony has stated the PS3 will also be backward compatible with all games that were originally made for PlayStation 1 as well as the PlayStation 2. (First-party) PS3 games will not be region-locked, but PlayStation 1 and 2 games will still only play on a PS3 console from the same territory.

The PlayStation Portable (officially PSP) is a handheld game console first released in late 2004.  Despite the name, it is not compatible with PlayStation games; it only runs games developed specifically for the PSP on the UMD format. However, at the PlayStation Briefing conference on March 15, 2006 in Japan, Sony revealed plans for PlayStation 1 games to be downloaded and playable on the PSP through emulation. Sony hopes to release nearly all PlayStation 1 games on a gradual basis. .  However, as of late December 2006, a custom firmware release allows users to play PS1 image files coverted into the PSP's EBOOT format.

The success of the PlayStation is widely thought to have had some influence on the demise of the cartridge-based home console.  While not the first system to utilize an optical disc format, it was the first success story, and ended up going head-to-head with the last major home console to rely on proprietary cartridges - the Nintendo 64.  Nintendo was very public about its skepticism toward using CDs and DVDs to store games, citing longer load times and durability issues.  It was widely speculated that the company was even more concerned with piracy, given its substantial reliance on licensing and exclusive titles for its revenue.  The success of Sony's PlayStation introduced high-quality sound and longer playing times as top priorities for modern gamers, leaving little choice for competitors but to follow suit.



Controversy.
To celebrate the ten-year anniversary of the PlayStation in 2005, Sony Italy released an advertisement portraying a young man wearing a crown of thorns (the thorns being made of triangle, square, circle and cross symbols, the labels on the buttons of Playstation controllers), on his head.  The ad was captioned with "Dieci anni di passione" (In English, this translates to "Ten years of passion.") The ad, assumed to be a takeoff of Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie The Passion of the Christ, was met with outrage from the Vatican. Sony apologized and stopped displaying the ad.

Quality of construction.
The laser in the CD player of early units was built into a plastic tray that slid back and forth on a set of metal tracks. Over time, friction caused the plastic tray to wear out-- usually unevenly. Eventually, the tray would become so worn that the laser no longer pointed directly at the CD and games would not load. Sony eventually fixed the problem by making the tray out of die-cast metal.

A common   but temporary   fix to the laser problem was to tip the PlayStation on its side. This made the tray "hang" perpendicular to the CD, allowing the PlayStation to read the disc. Unfortunately, friction would continue to wear down the plastic tray and, eventually, the PlayStation would not read the disc. 

Some units, particularly the early 100x models, would be unable to play FMV or music correctly, resulting in skipping or freezing. In more extreme cases the PlayStation would only work correctly when used upside down.

<doc id="6869593" title="Wii homebrew" nonfiltered="223" processed="221" dbindex="1480223">
Wii homebrew refers to the reuse of Nintendo's Wii game console hardware, accessories and software for purposes outside of those intended by the manufacturer. Key objectives are to provide open source tools to expand or alter the capabilities provided "out of the box".

At present good progress has been made on using the Wii controller as a pointing device on other operating systems. A long term goal is to run unsigned software on the console to allow homebrew games and applications to be used.

The support for Adobe Flash Player in the supplied Opera browser is being used to allow the development of games and applications which can be hosted within the browser environment. This kind of software is very limited in its ability to interact directly with the Wii hardware.

Homebrew software.
One of the most important goals being worked on is the ability to run homebrew games and applications that are not licensed by Nintendo. Due to the similarity between the Wii and the Nintendo GameCube hardware, it is hoped that the bulk of the homebrew development tools used for the GameCube will be usable in the Wii with little modification. However, the Wii includes improved protection against the execution of unauthorised executable code, and at present there is no identified method to bypass this protection.

It is currently possible to run GameCube homebrew on the Wii by using an Action Replay disc and an SD memory card adaptor, but the Wii limits most of its hardware to the capabilities of the GameCube in this mode, making it impossible to use the Wii's advanced features. One of the methods for running true Wii homebrew would involve finding a way to deactivate these limitations, bringing the Wii out of GameCube mode.

The Wii optical drive is very similar to that of the GameCube, and is believed it may have similar flaws and backdoors. The intention of Nintendo to add support for standard DVDs indicates it should be possible to persuade the Wii software to read standard DVDs to load programs and data. On the GameCube, this was a popular method for running homebrew software.

A published exploit in the current trial Opera browser for the Wii causes the system to crash. By crafting a carefully formatted page to take advantage of the exploit it might be possible to run executable code on the Wii. However, as the trial version of Opera will be updated in the next couple of months it is expected this exploit will be corrected by the vendor.

 Linux on the Wii .
As with many other platforms, there is an effort to port the Linux kernel and utilities to the Wii. As the Wii includes 802.11b/g hardware, a pointing device (the Wii Remote), USB ports, Bluetooth, an SD card slot, and internal Flash memory, it is more amenable to the porting of Linux than the older GameCube. It is thus expected that Linux on the Wii will be more popular and find many more uses than GameCube Linux. As the Wii is relatively cheap, it could provide a very good platform for small servers, media centers, and for general integration of traditionally desktop-computer based applications into a living room environment.

It is hoped that parts of GameCube Linux will be directly reusable on the Wii. Drivers will need to be developed for the extra features of the Wii, including the SD card slot and the wireless 802.11b/g and Bluetooth hardware. A driver for the Wii Remote is also required, and is already being developed for desktop Linux.

To run Linux, the capability to run native executable code is required. Thus, that issue must be addressed before development can proceed.

 Streaming Media on Wii .
The Adobe Flash support in the Opera browser has been used to enable the Wii to stream arbitrary content such as media files. An example is a java daemon called Wiisic which makes MP3 files on your PC available on your Wii via a local url. A more extensive solution has been developed called WiiCR. It acts as a streaming media server and is capable of transcoding nearly any video file for use with a flash player embedded in a local web page. It allows browsing of the remote filesystem to view video, images, text files, and play MP3s.

PC Software titled ORB from www.orb.com when installed on a capable PC can be used with the Opera browser to stream many types of media as well as recorded tv from a PC to the Wii.  This even works over an internet connection.

 Wii Remote .
A number of features of the Wii Remote have been reverse engineered allowing the development of drivers for Microsoft Windows, Linux and Mac OSX. The Bluetooth HID driver is used to interface with the computer using a custom report format.

 Official Avenues .
On 26th January 2007, Nintendo told 'Computer and Video Games' magazine that they had 'developed a programming system that will allow small independent developers to make games for Wii download service.' They declined to state the details of how this service would function. 

 Sites and projects .
Information on Wii internals is still largely incomplete, particularly the method the Wii uses to validate and execute code. As a result most of the effort to date has been the reuse of the Wii remote with other operating systems rather than modifications to the console itself.

To date, most of the various web sites serve to accumulate known information and link to third party accomplishments.

GlovePIE.
Glove Programmable Input Emulator (GlovePIE) provides support for novel input devices in Microsoft Windows and has been extended to support the Wii remote.

Wii PC Scripts provides scripts using GlovePIE that allow the Wii remote to be used with a range of Microsoft Windows games and applications.

 Wii Linux Project .
This project had some initial publicity when it posted a rumour pondering whether the Wii used a modified Linux kernel was reposted on Slashdot and Arstechnica. The author of the rumour later admitted it was a hoax. The web site has not been updated since November 2006 and is currently considered defunct.

 WiiAction Input Library .
The WiiAction input library is a C++ library for getting Nintendo Wii control support in PC applications. Although a demonstration video is available, no source or binaries have been made available due to legal concerns of the author.

 Wiibrew .
This aggregation web site was created as a result of downtime on the WiiLi web site during late 2006 and is presently an infrequently updated aggregation web site. It is also a permanent presence for the #wiidev IRC channel on EFNET.

 WiiLi .
Despite its claimed intention to port Linux to the Wii and some initial fund raising to support development effort, at present WiiLi only provides up to date aggregation of efforts by individual developers to reuse the Wii remote.

WiinRemote.
This project is developing a Microsoft Windows driver for the Wii remote.

 Wiire .
Provides detailed hardware information including images of Wii hardware internals.

<doc id="61175" title="The Thin Man (film)" nonfiltered="225" processed="223" dbindex="1480225">



The Thin Man was the first of six comic detective films starring William Powell and Myrna Loy as Nick and Nora Charles, a hard-drinking and flirtatious married couple who banter wittily as they easily solve crimes.  Their dog, the Wire-Haired Fox Terrier Asta, played by Skippy, was also a popular character.  

Completed in 1934 and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, the film was directed by W.S. Van Dyke from a script by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich; the screenplay was based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett, supposedly based on his relationship with playwright Lillian Hellman.  Also appearing in the film were Maureen O'Sullivan, Nat Pendleton, Minna Gombell, Cesar Romero, Porter Hall, Henry Wadsworth, William Henry, Harold Huber and Natalie Moorhead.

The "Thin Man" of the title was actually the lead suspect, but the name was thought by virtually everyone to refer to Nick Charles, and it was used in the titles of the sequels, although no one ever called him that.

This movie was followed by five sequels:
After the Thin Man (1936);
Another Thin Man (1939);
Shadow of the Thin Man (1941);
The Thin Man Goes Home (1944);
Song of the Thin Man (1947);

The 1934 film has been selected for preservation in the United States' National Film Registry.

Radio and television.
The Adventures of the Thin Man radio series, initially starring Les Damon and Claudia Morgan, was broadcast on all four major radio networks during the years 1941 to 1950.

The half-hour weekly TV series, produced by MGM Television, was shown on NBC for two seasons from 1957 1959, starring Peter Lawford and Phyllis Kirk as the Charleses. In 1975, Craig Stevens and Jo Ann Pflug starred in the television film Nick and Nora. A 1991 musical, Nick and Nora, starring Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason in the title roles, closed after only nine performances.

Christian Louboutin (born 1963) is a well known French shoe designer. 

Biography.
Christian Louboutin was interested in women's fashion since he was a small child. In 1979, as he was walking alongside the streets of Paris, he noticed a billboard that instructed women tourists not to scratch the wooden floor in front of the Museum of Oceanic Art. 

Louboutin felt personally bothered by this sign, and, as a consequence, he would draw shoes with compressed buckles and with soles. He admits to having spent a lot of time as a teenager drawing these types of shoes in his school notebooks. These shoes would become the base of Louboutin's sales as a designer. 

Later on, Louboutin began attending parties and dance halls in Paris, offering his shoes to women at these events and venues. Most of the ladies rejected his shoes, claiming to have no money.

Louboutin then decided to attend various designing schools, such as Chanel's and Saint Laurent's. 

Louboutin later opened a boutique shop in Paris; his store became distinguished not only because of his clientele, but also because he offered free coffee to shoppers. Such other sellers as American company Neiman Marcus began to sell Louboutin's designs. Louboutin shoes also have a trademark red leather sole, making them instantly recognizable. 

Louboutin, who has been interviewed by fashion reporters such as Jacques Brunel, has seen his celebrity expand to such places like Monte Carlo, Singapore and the United States, among others.  He includes Princess Caroline of Monaco and Catherine Deneuve among his friends.

<doc id="934118" title="Laskarina Bouboulina" nonfiltered="232" processed="230" dbindex="1480232">

Laskarina Bouboulina (Greek:                       , 11 May 1771 - 22 May 1825) was a Greek heroine of the Greek War of Independence in 1821. 

Early life.
Bouboulina was born in a prison in Constantinople. She was the daughter of captain Stavrianos Pinotsis and his wife Skevo. The Ottomans had imprisoned Pinotsis because he had taken part in the failed Orlof Revolution of 1769-1770 against the Ottoman rule. Her father died soon afterwards and the mother and the child returned to the island of Hydra. Four years later, when her mother married Dimitrios Lazarou-Orlof, they moved to the island of Spetses. Bouboulina had eight half-siblings.

She married twice, first to Dimitrios Yiannouzas and later to Dimitrios Bouboulis. D. Bouboulis, was killed in a battle against Algerian pirates in 1811. Bouboulina took over his fortune and trading business and built four ships, including one large warship Agamemnon, at her own expense.

In 1816, the Ottomans tried to confiscate Bouboulina's property because her second husband had fought for the Russians against the Turks in the Turko-Russian wars. Bouboulina sailed to Constantinople to meet Russian ambassador Strogonoff to seek his protection because of her husband's services to the Russians. Strogonoff sent her to safety in Crimea. She also met with the mother of Mahmud II who reputedly convinced her son to leave Bouboulina's property alone. After three months of exile in the Crimea, Bouboulina returned to Spetses.

Support of the independence movement.
Bouboulina joined the Filiki Etaireia, an underground organization that was preparing for revolution against the Ottoman rule, as its only female member. She bought arms and ammunitions at her own expense and brought them secretly to Spetses in her ships, to fight "For the sake of my nation" as she said. Construction of the ship Agamemnon was finished 1820. It was later one of the largest warships in the hands of Greek rebels. Bouboulina bribed Turkish officials to ignore the ship's size. She also organized her own armed troops, composed of men from Spetses. She used most of her fortune to provide food and ammunition for the sailors and soldiers under her command.

On 13 March 1821 Bouboulina raised her own Greek flag, based on the flag of the Comnenus dynasty of Byzantine emperors, on the mast of Agamemnon. On 3 April the people of Spetses revolted and later joined forces with a number of other ships from other Greek islands. Bouboulina sailed with eight ships to Nafplion and began a naval blockade. She led her own troops until the fall of the fort in 13 November 1822. Later she took part in the naval blockade and capture of Monemvasia and Pylos. In the battle at Argos, Bouboulina's son, Yiannis Yiannouzas, died in combat against superior numbers of Ottoman troops.

She arrived in time to witness the fall of Tripolis on 11 September 1821 and met general Theodoros Kolokotronis. Later their children Eleni Boubouli and Panos Kolokotronis were married. During the ensuing extermination of the Ottoman garison, Bouboulina saved most of the female members of the sultan's household.

After independence.
After independence, when the opposing factions erupted into a civil war in 1824, the Greek government arrested Bouboulina because of her family connection to now-imprisoned Kolokotronis; the government also killed her son-in-law. She was eventually exiled back to Spetses. She had used all of her fortune for the war of independence.

Death in feud.
Laskarina Bouboulina was killed in 1825 as the result of a family feud in Spetses. The daughter of a Koutsis family had eloped with Bouboulina's son, Yeorgios Yiannouzas. The father of the girl, Christodoulos Koutsis, and armed members of his family went to Bouboulina's house seeking her. Infuriated, Bouboulina showed up in the balcony of her house to confront them. After her argument with Christodoulos Koutsis, someone shot her in the chest. The killer was not identified. Bouboulina's last words were, "Help me stand, I want to see the sea before I die".

Heritage.
Descendants of Bouboulina gave the ship Agamemnon to the Greek state. It was renamed Spetses and became a Greek navy flagship. It was burned in the naval base of Poros by Andreas Miaoulis during the next Greek civil war in 1831.

On the island of Spetses there is a museum dedicated to Bouboulina called "Bouboulina's Museum", which is housed in the 300 year-old mansion of Bouboulina's second husband, where her descendants still live. A statue of Bouboulina also stands in the harbor in Spetses.

Various streets all over Greece and Cyprus were named after her, with most notable examples of: the Bouboulina's Street near the National Technical University of Athens (the Polytechnion), in central Athens, Bouboulina Street in Piraeus, the largest port-city of Greece and Nicosia, capital of Cyprus.

Cornelius Essex (d. 1680) was an English buccaneer who took part in Captain Bartholomew Sharp's privateering expedition, the "Pacific Adventure", during the late 1670s. 

Although much of his early life is unknown, he is first recorded being brought with his ship, the Great Dolphin, to Port Royal by the HMS Hunter in November 1679 and tried with twenty of his crew for "riotously comporting themselves" as well as charges of looting the plantation of a Major Samuel Jenck's of St. James' parish for which two men were sentenced to death . 

Essex, as did the other Captains, held a commission by the Jamaican government that granted them permission to cut logwood in Honduras and left Port Morant in December 1679 with Captain John Coxon, Robert Allison, Thomas Mackett, Jean Rose and a Captain Bournano and rendezvoused at the Isles of Pines near eastern Panama shortly after. 

Following the election of Coxon as head of the party, the privateers traced the old route Sir Henry Morgan had taken in his raid on Portobello in 1668. After anchoring at a deserted cay, he was one of the privateers that participated in the overland assault on the Spanish stronghold and was among thirty others killed in a surprise attack against the garrison.

Bucket Racing is a discipline of motorcycle sport, which is very popular in Australia and New Zealand due to the low cost of competing. 

Origins.
Bucket racing was originally started by motorcycling enthusiasts in New Zealand, around 1980. It quickly became very popular, and spread to Australia by 1988. The name derives from the slang phrase `bucket of shit', or similar Bowdlerised terms; rather than the usual finely-tuned racing machines that traditionally graced racing circuits, these bikes were often recycled ex-road machines that had been crashed or fallen into disrepair.

The original idea was to take a low powered commuter motorcycle with a maximum capacity of 150cc and remove the entire road going gear, thus creating absolutely the cheapest form of motorcycle racing in the country.

And so began one of the most enduring forms of motorcycle racing that New South Wales and Australia has seen in the post war period. At its height in the mid 90 s, NSW race meetings enjoyed up to 60 competitors at every meeting, divided into Amateur and Pro classes   essentially, junior and senior riders based on experience and ability.

As a form of inexpensive racing the class has seen participation from teenagers to retirees, attracted to the sport by its low cost and accessibility. Bikes prepared for bucket racing still sell for as little as $500 still making it the cheapest form of amateur racing available to anyone who can ride a bike

Bucket Racing Develops.
A bucket racing matured it bred a group of  Garagists , enthusiasts who developed their racing bikes into highly crafted and very speedy racing machines. The addition of racing seats, fiberglass fairings, rear set footrests and gear changes and racing handlebars made some these machines replicas of more modern production racing machines

In addition, home developers engineered the motors of these machines and dramatically increased power outputs from the normal road going power of around 8 12 horse power to outputs often in excess of 20 horse power. It is a tribute to home developers that they were able to create motors that produced power outputs that are directly proportional to factory made GP production race machines

Ansa or Ansia was the wife of Desiderius, King of the Lombards. She was probably a Lombard, the daughter of Verissimo and sister of Arechis and Donnolo. 

In or around 753, she founded the monastery of S. Michele and S. Pietro at Brescia. It later merged with that of S. Salvatore and S. Maria. After 759, she appeared frequently in Desiderius' diplomas and was probably the architect of his religious policy. 

On 5 June 774, she was presented along with her husband to Charlemagne, who had conquered Pavia. She was sent with her husband and an unnamed daughter, probably Gerperga, to Liège or Corbie, but allowed to return in 775. Paul the Deacon wrote an Epitaphium Ansae reginae praising her politics, her piety, and her beauty: coniunx pulcherrima, "most beautiful wife". 

Her children with Desiderius were:
Anselperga (or Anselberga), abbess of San Salvatore ;
Adelperga (or Adelberga), married Arechis II of Benevento ;
Liutperga (also Liutpirc or Liutberga), married Tassilo III of Bavaria ;
Gerperga (or Gerberga), married Charlemagne in 768, divorced in 771 ;
Adelchis (or Adalgis), patrician in Constantinople;

The New Bill Cosby Show was a variety television series aired in the United States by CBS as part of its 1972-73 lineup.

The New Bill Cosby Show was an attempt to exploit the widespread popularity of Bill Cosby, who had previously starred in an eponymous sitcom and the drama (with comedic undertones) I Spy and who had been responsible for several of the best-selling comedy albums of the 1960s.  Cosby's supporting cast was biracial, highlighted by Foster Brooks of "funny-drunk" routine fame and also included performer Lola Falana, who additionally served as the show's announcer, and other persons previously best known as comedy writers, including Ronny Graham and Pat McCormick.  Quincy Jones' orchestra provided the music.  Ongoing sketches included "The Wife of the Week" and the adventures of "The Dude", a man who was so impossibly cool that nothing whatever could faze him or cause him in any way to lose his composure or coolness.

Palaka (or 'Kpalaga') is a central Senufo language spoken by approximately 8 000 people (1995 SIL) in northern Côte d'Ivoire. It is bordered to the south by Djimini, a southern Senufo language, and to the west by Nyarafolo, another Senufo language. North and east of the Palaka area live Dioula people. 

Palaka constitutes a separate branch of the Senufo languages on its own, being rather different from them in morphology and phonology. It has been tentatively linked to Nafaanra language, an isolated Senufo language spoken in Ghana. Palaka has been separated from the other Senufo languages at least since the fourteenth century AD.

<doc id="7278952" title="William Aspdin" nonfiltered="240" processed="238" dbindex="1480240">
William Aspdin (23 September 1815   1864) was an English cement manufacturer, and a pioneer of the Portland cement industry.

Biography.
He was born in Leeds.  His father, Joseph obtained a patent for "Portland cement" in 1824 and William joined his father's cement manufacturing firm in 1829.  His father's product was a fast-setting material usable only in mortars and stuccos.  During the next ten years, William evidently noticed that a significantly different product, with much wider applications, could be made by modifying the cement's formulation.  By increasing the limestone content in the mixture, and burning it much harder, a slow-setting, high-strength product suitable for use in concrete could be obtained.  This product was substantially more expensive to make, in terms of cost of extra limestone, cost of extra fuel, and difficult grinding of the hard clinker.  It is unclear whether William actually made this product at his father's plant, but in 1841 he left the firm after major disagreements with his father.

He immediately set up a manufacturing plant at Northfleet, Kent, and was soon making a cement that caused a sensation among users in London.  Although this product, referred to today as "modern" Portland cement, was entirely different mineralogically from that of his father, William did not take out a patent, or give it a new name.  Apparently, he was aware of the competence of a number of competing manufacturers near to his North Kent plant, and decided that any patent would quickly be infringed by all his rivals.  He therefore decided to claim that the product was covered by his father's patent, and clothed the details of his methods in secrecy.  Famously, he would emerge from his office when each newly-loaded kiln was ready for firing, and scatter in handfuls of brightly-coloured crystals over the rawmix, in order to give the impression that the special properties of his product were the result of an unidentified "magic ingredient".  This strategy kept competition at bay for two years, after which I C Johnson succeeded in matching the product at J B White & Co's nearby Swanscombe plant.  See the link for Johnson's own account of this.

He contracted several partnerships in order to finance his operations.  He sold out his share of the Northfleet plant in 1852, and set up in Gateshead, County Durham.  In 1857, he sold out again, and moved to Germany.  From 1860, he set up cement plants at Altona and Lagerdorf, these being the first plants to make modern Portland cement outside the UK.  He died at Itzehoe near Hamburg.

Like his father, William had no chemical knowledge, and his innovations were purely the result of luck.  His contribution (although he was unaware of it) was to make the first cement containing alite as an active ingredient.  His finances were chaotic, and he was bankrupt at least twice.  At each relocation, he was pursued by angry creditors.  However, he always took sufficient cash from his businesses to live comfortably, and constructed a substantial concrete mansion - Portland Hall - in Gravesend, Kent.

Fan Chan (Thai:       , English: My Girl) is a 2003 Thai romantic comedy film offering a nostalgic look back at the childhood friendship of a boy and girl growing up in a small town in Thailand in the 1980s. It was the debut film by six young screenwriter-directors, Vitcha Gojiew, Songyos Sugmakanan, Nithiwat Tharathorn, Witthaya Thongyooyong, Anusorn Trisirikasem and Komgrit Triwimol. With a soundtrack that featured Thai pop music of the era, Fan Chan was the top domestic film at the Thailand box office in 2003, earning 140 million baht.

Plot.

Jeab, a young man working in Bangkok, receives word that his best friend from childhood, Noi-Naa is to be married. While driving back to his hometown, the memories of his friendship with her come flooding back, and their story is told in a flashback.

Jeab and Noi-Naa live in a small city. Their fathers are rival barbers, with shops situated next to each other, with only a sweet shop to separate them. Jeab's father favors efficiency and uses an electric trimmer. Noi-Naa's father, meanwhile, has a more contemplative, artistic approach, and uses scissors. Jeab notes that the results of both methods seem to be the same.


The school holiday is ended. Jeab is notorious for oversleeping, so that each day he misses the school bus and must be driven part way by his father on a motorcycle. By taking a shortcut, Jeab and his father are able to catch up to the bus, but only just in time.

On the bus, other boys are introduced. Their ringleader is an overweight bully named Jack. On the bus, the children talk about what they are going to do after school. The boys decide they will play Chinese fantasy characters, while the girls plan to play "house".

Because Jeab must cross a busy street to play with the boys, and he fears getting hit by a car, he stays to play with the girls, which makes him the target of much taunting by Jack and the other boys.

Then, one day, Jack and his friends are playing soccer against a rival neighborhood gang. They are one player short. Jeab happens to be hanging around, and he's asked to join the game, proving his abilities.

He earns the trust of Jack's gang, and passes various tests in order to join. But the one thing he must do is sever his ties to Noi-Naa. Jeab does so, quite literally, by cutting a rubber-band jump rope, which Noi-Naa is skilled at playing with.

From that moment on, Noi-Naa refuses to talk to Jeab. Then, one day, Jeab gets word that Noi-Naa is moving away. And, of course, on the day she is to leave, Jeab oversleeps and misses the chance to say his final goodbye to Noi-Naa. Jeab then gets Jack and his friends to commandeer a delivery motorcycle and pursue Noi-Naa and her family in their moving truck. But the motorcycle breaks down, and the truck rolls out of sight. Jeab is to never see Noi-Naa again ... until her wedding.

Harridge Pike is a hill situated within the boundaries of Stalybridge, Greater Manchester just outside the Peak District National Park. Its western flank rises from the valley of the River Tame to a height of 395 metres. To the east, the pike falls away more gradually to Swineshaw Moor which, above the Swineshaw reservoirs rises to Irontongue Hill, a broad shoulder of Hoarstone Edge. Since 2004, the moorland in the area of the pike has been classed as access land. From the summit of Harridge Pike, a view is afforded of the middle section of the Tame valley and the whole of the town of Stalybridge, large swathes of the eastern suburbs of Manchester and beyond to Manchester city centre, where  its town hall is visible. On exceptionally clear days the mountains of Snowdonia are visible.

The Lady Nelson was a vessel used in the exploration of the coast of Australia in the early years of the 19th century.  

Description.


The Lady Nelson was named in honour of the wife of Horatio Nelson, England's naval hero. She was built in Deptford, England in 1799 and purchased by the Royal Navy in 1800.

She was a Brig designed especially for inshore exploration, with a draught of only 6', and three sliding keels. This unusual feature was originally conceived by naval architect John Schank.

Her length was 52'6", her tonnage 60 tonnes, and she was originally armed with 2 brass carriage guns. Her crew consisted of fifteen men: the commander, two mates, and twelve seamen.

She was fitted out with a further four guns and provisions for 9 months and sent to Australia under the command of Lieutenant James Grant.

Exploration of the Victorian coast.
The Lady Nelson reached the western coast of Victoria, Australia in December 1800, and was subsequently the first vessel to pass through Bass Strait on her way to Sydney. Grant named Cape Schanck, Mount Gambier, Northumberland Cape, Cape Banks, Cape Bridgewater, Mount Schank, Lady Julia Percy Island, Portland Bay, Point Danger and Cape Otway along the southern coast.  After arriving in Sydney, she soon turned around to further explore the south coast, now with John Murray aboard as first mate, and surveyed as far as Westernport Bay. However, her most famous southern voyage was in early 1802 when John Murray, having been given command of the Lady Nelson, discovered the entrance to Port Phillip Bay. On the same voyage he also surveyed King Island and the Kent Group.

Association with Matthew Flinders.
The Lady Nelson is also associated with Matthew Flinders. In 1803 the Lady Nelson was intended to accompany Flinders' other survey ship, the Investigator, in surveying the coast north of Sydney. However, she accompanied the Investigator only as far as Cumberland Island when Flinders decided she was unseaworthy and sent her back.

The Loss of the Lady Nelson to Privateers.
On September 22nd 1825, The Sydney Gazette reported: 'The Lady Nelson, brig, has been most unfortunately cut off at Timor by Malay privateers and all the crew sacrificed, except the Captain.   The little 60 ton ship contributed more to the exploration and settlement than any other.   She served in the colony for a quarter of a century'.

Modern replica.
A modern replica of the Lady Nelson was built in  c. 1988 and is based in Tasmania and operates as a sail training vessel after a recent 4-month refurbishment.

<doc id="335665" title="History of Poland (1569?1795)" nonfiltered="246" processed="244" dbindex="1480246">



The Nihil novi act adopted by the Polish Diet in 1505 transferred all legislative power from the king to the Diet. This event marked the beginning of the period known as "Nobles' Democracy" or "Nobles' Commonwealth" (Rzeczpospolita szlachecka) when the state was ruled by the "free and equal" Polish nobility (szlachta). The Lublin Union of 1569 constituted the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth as an influential player in European politics and a vital cultural entity. By the 18th century the nobles' democracy gradually declined into anarchy, making the once powerful Commonwealth vulnerable to foreign influence. Eventually the country was partitioned by its neighbors and erased from the map in 1795.

 Founding of The Elective Monarchy.

The death of Sigismund II Augustus in 1572 was followed by a three-year interregnum period during which adjustments were made to the constitutional system. The lower nobility was now included in the selection process, and the power of the monarch was further circumscribed in favor of the expanded noble class. Each king had to sign the so called Henrician Articles, which were the basis of the political system of Poland, and pacta conventa which were various personal obligations of the chosen king. From that point, the king was effectively a partner with the noble class and constantly supervised by a group of senators. Once the Jagiellons disappeared from the scene, the fragile equilibrium of the Commonwealth government began to go awry. The constitutional reforms made the monarchy electoral in fact as well as name. As more and more power went to the noble electors, it also eroded from the government's center.



In its periodic opportunities to fill the throne, the szlachta exhibited a preference for foreign candidates who would not found another strong dynasty.  This policy produced monarchs who were either totally ineffective or in constant debilitating conflict with the nobility. Furthermore, aside from notable exceptions such as the able Transylvanian Stefan Batory (1576-1586), the kings of alien origin were inclined to subordinate the interests of the Commonwealth to those of their own country and ruling house.

Henryk II Walezy (1572 1573).

Henry II Walezy was elected a king of the Commonwealth in 1572, but shortly after, at the death of his brother Charles IX, he fled Poland and returned to France to be crowned as Henry III of France.

Stefan Batory (1576 1586). 

Poland defeated Russia's Ivan the Terrible and retrieved most of the lost provinces, including Livland. At the end of his reign, Poland ruled two main Baltic sea ports: Gda sk controlling the Vistula river trade and Riga controlling Western Dvina trade. Both cities were among the largest in the country.


During the Livonian War (1558 1582), between Ivan the Terrible of Russia and Stefan Batory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, the city was besieged by Polish forces. Poland failed to capture the city, but Batory, with his chancellor Jan Zamojski, led the Polish army in a brilliant decisive campaign and forced Russia to return other territories and gained Livonia and Polock.  In 1582 the war ended with Commonwealth victory with the peace treaty in Jam Zapolski.

Stefan Bathory planned a Christian alliance against the Islamic Ottomans.  He proposed an anti-Ottoman alliance with Russia, which he considered a necessary step for his anti-Ottoman crusade. However, Russia was on the way to the Time of Troubles so he could not find a partner there. When Stefan Bathory died, there was a one year interregnum.  Emperor Mathias's brother Maximilian III tried to claim title of King of Poland, but was defeated at Byczyna in 1588 and Sigismund III Vasa followed Stefan Bathory's reign.

House of Vasa.
Zygmunt III Waza (1587 1632).
 
The first few years of Sigismund's reign, until 1598 saw Poland and Sweden united in a personal union that made the Baltic sea an internal lake (the Polish-Swedish union). However, the rebellion in Sweden started the chain of events that would involve Commonwealth in more than a century of warfare with Sweden.

In the end, Sigismund III Waza failed to strengthen the Commonwealth nor to solve its internal problems; instead he concentrated on a futile attempt to regain his former Swedish throne.

Polish-Sweden-Muscovy Wars.


Sigismund desire to reclaim the throne drove Sigismund into prolonged military adventures waged against his native Sweden under Charles IX and later also Russia. In 1598 Sigismund tried to defeat Charles with a mixed army from Sweden and Poland but was defeated in the battle of Stångebro. The war continued, punctuated by many ceasefires and broken peace treaties. On occasion, these campaigns brought Poland to a nearly complete conquest of Russia and the Baltic coast during the Time of Troubles and False Dimitris, had it not been for the military burden imposed by the ongoing rivalry on multiple borders: the Ottoman Empire, the Swedes and the Russians.

The southern wars.


Commonwealth-Ottomans relations were never too warm, as the Commonwealth viewed itself as the 'bulwark of the Christendom' and together with Habsburgs and Republic of Venice was the thorn in the Ottoman plans of European conquest. Since the second half of the 16th century, Polish-Ottomans relations, never too friendly, were further worsened by the escalation of Cossacks-Tatars border warfare, which turned the entire border region between the Commonwealth and Ottoman Empire into a semi-permanent warzone. 

In the 1595, magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth intervened in the affairs of Moldavia. This would start a series of conflicts that would soon spread to Transylvania, Wallachia and Hungary, when the Commonwealth forces clashed with the forces backed by Ottoman Empire and occasionally Habsburgs, all competing for the domination over that region. 

With the Commonwealth engaged on its northern and eastern borders with near constant conflicts against Sweden and Muscovy, its armies were spread thin. Finally, the southern wars culminated in the Polish defeat at the battle of Cecora in 1620. Eventually the Commonwealth was forced to renounce all claims to Moldavia, Transylvania, Wallachia and Hungary.

Religious and social tensions.

The population of Poland-Lithuania was neither overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nor Polish. This circumstance resulted from the federation with Lithuania, where ethnic Poles were a distinct minority. In those days, to be Polish was much less an indication of ethnicity than of rank; it was a designation largely reserved for the landed noble class, which included members of Polish and non-Polish origin alike. Generally speaking, the ethnically non-Polish noble families of Lithuania adopted the Polish language and culture. As a result, in the eastern territories of the kingdom a Polish aristocracy dominated over a peasantry whose great majority was neither Polish nor Catholic. Moreover, the decades of peace brought huge colonization efforts to Ukraine, which heightened tensions between peasants, Jews and nobles. The tensions were aggravated by the conflicts between Orthodox and Greek Catholic churches following the Union of Brest and by several Cossack uprisings. On the West and North, cities had big German minorities, often of reformed belief.

W adys aw IV Waza (1632-1648).


Wladislaw tried to achieve many military goals, including conquest of Russia, Sweden and Turkey. His reign is that of many small victories, few of them bringing anything worthwhile to the Commonwealth. For a time, he was elected a tsar, but never had any control over Russian territories. In the end, like his father, he failed to strengthen the Commonwealth or prevent the crippling events of The Deluge or Chmielnicki Rebellion, that devastated the Commonwealth in 1648.

Jan Kazimierz Vasa (1648 1668).

The reign of the last of Vasas in the Commonwealth would be dominated by the culmination in the war with Sweden, groundwork for which was laid down by the two previous Vasa kings of the Commonwealth.

In 1660 Jan Kazimierz would be forced to renounce his claims to the Swedish throne and acknowledge Swedish sovereignty over Livonia and city of Riga. He abdicated on 16 September 1668 and returned to France where he joined the Jesuit order and became an ordinary monk. He died in 1672.

Chmielnicki Uprising, 1648-1654.


This largest  of all Cossacks rebellions, led by Bohdan Khmelnytsky, proved disastrous for the Commonwealth. In the end, Commonwealth not only lost parts of its territory to Russia, but was weakened at the moment of invasion by Sweden.

The Deluge, (1648-1667).

Although Poland-Lithuania escaped the ravages of the Thirty Years' War, which ended in 1648, the ensuing two decades subjected the country to one of its severest trials. This colorful but ruinous interval, the stuff of legend and the popular historical novels of Nobel laureate Henryk Sienkiewicz, became known as the potop, or deluge, for the magnitude and suddenness of its hardships. The emergency began with an uprising of Cossacks in Ukraine that culminated in a reassertion of an independent Cossack nation centered in Kyiv, in spite of Warsaw's efforts to subdue it by force. After the Cossacks concluded the Treaty of Pereyaslav with Russia, prolonged and increasing Russian intervention began in the Ukrainian and Belarusian territories. Taking advantage of Poland's preoccupation and weakness, Charles X of Sweden rapidly overran much of the remaining territory of the Commonwealth in the same year. Pushed to the brink of dissolution, Poland-Lithuania rallied to recover most of its losses from the Swedes. In exchange for breaking the alliance with Sweden, the ruler of Ducal Prussia was released from his vassalage and became a de facto independent sovereign, while much of the Polish Protestant nobility went over to the side of the Swedes. Swedish brutality, and especially the ineffectual siege of Jasna Gora monastery in Czestochowa in winter of 1655-1656, raised widespread revolts against Charles, whom a part of Polish nobles had recognized as their ruler in the meantime. Under hetman Stefan Czarniecki, the Poles and Lithuanians had driven the Swedes from their territory by 1657.  

Further complicated by dissenting nobles and wars with the Ottoman Turks, the thirteen-year struggle over control of Ukraine ended in the Truce of Andrusovo in 1667. Although Russians had been ousted from Wilno and Lwow by 1662, the Tsar gained eastern Ukraine in the peace treaty.

Despite the improbable survival of the Commonwealth in the face of the potop, one of the most dramatic instances of the Poles' knack for prevailing in adversity, the episode inflicted irremediable damage and contributed heavily to the ultimate demise of the state. When Jan II Kazimierz abdicated in 1668, the population of the Commonwealth had been nearly halved by war and disease. War had destroyed the economic base of the cities and raised a religious fervor that ended Poland's policy of religious tolerance. Henceforth, the Commonwealth would be on the strategic defensive facing hostile neighbors. Not until the Polish-Soviet War of the early 20th century would Poland compete with Russia as a military equal.

Commonwealth after the Deluge.

In the Treaty of Oliwa in 1660, John II of Poland finally renounced his claims to the Swedish Crown, which ended the feud between Sweden and the Commonwealth and the accompanying string of wars between those countries (War against Sigismund (1598-1599), Polish-Swedish War (1600-1629) and the Northern Wars (1655-1660)).

After the Treaty of Andrusovo in 1667 and the Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686, the Commonwealth lost left-bank Ukraine to Russia.

Polish culture and the Greek Catholic Church gradually advanced and by the 18th century, the population of Ducal Prussia was a mixture of Catholics and Protestants and used both the German and Polish languages. The rest of Poland and most of Lithuania remained firmly Roman Catholic, while Ukraine and some parts of Lithuania (i.e., Belarus) were Greek Orthodox. The society was split into a polonized upper stratum and peasants of other nationalities.

Decay of the Commonwealth.

During the 18th century the Polish crown itself became
subject to the manipulations of Russia, Sweden, the Kingdom of Prussia, France and Austria. Poland's weakness was exacerbated by an unworkable constitution which allowed each noble or gentry representative in the Sejm to use his vetoing power to stop further parliamentary proceedings for the given session. This greatly weakened the central authority of Poland and paved the way for its destruction.

Most accounts of Polish history show the two centuries after the end of the Jagiellon dynasty as a time of decline leading to foreign domination. 

Before another hundred years have elapsed, Poland-Lithuania had virtually ceased to function as a coherent and genuinely independent state. The commonwealth's last martial triumph occurred in 1683 when King Jan Sobieski drove the Turks from the gates of Vienna with a heavy cavalry charge. Poland's important role in aiding the European alliance to roll back the Ottoman Empire was rewarded with some territory in Podole by the Treaty of Karlowicz (1699). Nonetheless, this isolated success did little to mask the internal weakness and paralysis of the Polish-Lithuanian political system. For the next quarter century, Poland was often a pawn in Russia's campaigns against other powers.  Augustus II of Saxony, who succeeded Jan Sobieski, involved Poland in Peter the Great's war with Sweden, incurring another round of occupation and devastation by the Swedes between 1704 and 1710.

In the eighteenth century, the powers of the monarchy and the central administration became purely formal. Kings were denied permission to provide for the elementary requirements of defense and finance, and aristocratic clans made treaties directly with foreign sovereigns.  Attempts at reform were stymied by the determination of the szlachta to preserve their "golden freedoms" as well as the liberum veto. Because of the chaos sown by the veto provision, under Augustus III (1733-63) only one of thirteen Sejm sessions ran to an orderly adjournment.

Unlike Spain and Sweden, great powers that were allowed to settle peacefully into secondary status at the periphery of Europe at the end of their time of glory, Poland endured its decline at the strategic crossroads of the continent.  Lacking central leadership and impotent in foreign relations, Poland-Lithuania became a chattel of the ambitious kingdoms that surrounded it, an immense but feeble buffer state. During the reign of Peter the Great (1682-1725), the commonwealth fell under the dominance of Russia, and by the middle of the eighteenth century Poland-Lithuania had been made a virtual protectorate of its eastern neighbor, retaining only the theoretical right to self-rule.

The Polish succession war was fought from 1733-1735.

Michael Korybut Wisniowiecki (King 1669 1673).


Following the abdication of King Jan Kazimierz Vasa and the end of The Deluge, the Polish nobility (szlachta) elected Michael as king, believing he would further the interests of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. He was the first monarch of Polish origin since the last of Jagiellonian Dynasty, Sigismund II Augustus, died in 1572. Michael was a son of a successful but controversial military commander Jeremi Micha  Wi niowiecki, known for his actions during the Chmielnicki Uprising led by Bohdan Chmielnicki.

His reign was less than successful, and the nobility was not satisfied with the House of Vasa's dynastic policies. Despite his fathers military fame Michael lost a war against the Ottoman Empire, with Turks occupying Podolia. He was unable to cope with his responsibilities and with the different quarreling factions within Poland.

John III Sobieski (King 1674 1696).


John III Sobieski most famous achievement was to deal crushing defeat to the Ottoman Empire in 1683 at the Battle of Vienna, which marked the final turning point in a 250-year struggle between the forces of Christian Europe and the Islamic Ottoman Empire. Over the 16 years following the battle (the so-called Great Turkish War), the Turks would be permanently driven south of the Danube River, never to threaten central Europe again.

Augustus II the Strong (Wettin) (King 1697 1706, 1709 1733).
Augustus II the Strong, also known as Frederick Augustus I, Prince-Elector of Saxony, was an over-ambitious ruler. He defeated his biggest rival, François Louis, Prince of Conti, supported by France, and Sobieski's son, Jakub. To ensure his success for the crown of Poland he decided to convert to Roman Catholicism from Lutheranism. Augustus hoped to make the Polish throne hereditary within his family, and to use his resources as Elector of Saxony to impose some order on the chaotic Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. However, he was soon distracted from his internal reform projects by the possibility of external conquest. He involved the Commonwealth in the disastrous Great Northern War. His attempts of internal reforms and strengthening the royal power came to nothing, but his mistakes allowed Russian Empire to strengthen its influence over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Stanislaw Leszczynski (King 1706 1709, 1733 1736).
Seen as a puppet of Sweden, Leszczynski ruled in times of turmoil, and was soon cut off from the throne. He emerged in the election of 1733, supported by France, but after the military intervention of the Russian army, from which he was defending himself in Gda sk, he was forced to leave the country once again, ruling successfully in Lorraine.

August III Wettin (King 1733 1763).
Also Elector of Saxony (as Frederick Augustus II), August II, after his father's death inherited Saxony and was elected king of Poland with support of Russian and Austrian troops. August II was disinterested in the affairs of his Polish dominion, which he viewed mostly as a source of funds and resources for strengthening his power in Saxony. During his 30 year-reign, he spent less than 3 years in Poland. He delegated most of his powers and responsibilities to count Heinrich Bruhl. 30 years of August II disinterested reign festered the political anarchy and further weakened the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, while neighboring Prussia, Austria and Russia finalized plans for the partitions of Poland.

The Three Partitions, (1764-1795).

During the reign of Empress Catherine the Great (1762-1796), Russia intensified its manipulation in Polish affairs. The Kingdom of Prussia and Austria, the other powers surrounding the republic, also took advantage of internal religious and political bickering to divide up the country in three partition stages. After two partitions, the third one in 1795 eventually wiped Poland-Lithuania from the map of Europe. 

Stanis aw August Poniatowski (King 1764 1795).
First Partition.

In 1764 Catherine dictated the election of her former favorite, Stanis aw August Poniatowski, as king of Poland-Lithuania. Confounding expectations that he would be an obedient servant of his mistress, Stanislaw August encouraged the modernization of his realm's ramshackle political system and achieved a temporary moratorium on use of the individual veto in the Sejm (1764-1766). This turnabout threatened to renew the strength of the monarchy and brought displeasure in the foreign capitals that preferred an inert, pliable Poland. Catherine, being among the most displeased by Poniatowski's independence, encouraged religious dissension in Poland-Lithuania's substantial Eastern Orthodox population, which earlier in the eighteenth century had lost the rights enjoyed during the Jagiellon Dynasty.

Under heavy Russian pressure, the Sejm introduced Orthodox and Protestant  equality in 1767. Through the Polish nobles that Russia controlled and Russian Minister to Warsaw Prince Nikolai Repnin, Czarina Catherine the Great forced a constitution, which undid the reforms of 1764 under Stanislaw II, on Poland in 1767.  The liberum veto and all the old abuses of the last 1 1/4 centuries were guaranteed as unalterable parts of this new constitution. 
Poland was compelled to sign Treaty of Guarantee with Russia, where Catharina was imposed as protector of Polish political system. Since then Poland has becomed de facto a Russian protectorate. Real power in Rzeczpospolita have Russian ambassadors. Polish king becomed only an executor of their will.
This action provoked a Catholic uprising by the Confederation of Bar, a league of Polish nobles that fought with Russian intervention until 1772 to revoke Catherine's mandate.

The defeat of the Confederation of Bar again left Poland exposed to the ambitions of its neighbors. Although Catherine initially opposed partition, Frederick the Great of Prussia profited from Austria's threatening military position to the southwest by pressing a long-standing proposal to carve territory from the commonwealth.  Catherine, persuaded that Russia did not have the resources to continue its unilateral domination of Poland, agreed. In 1772 Russia, Prussia, and Austria forced terms of partition upon the helpless commonwealth under the pretext of restoring order in the anarchic conditions of the country.

National Revival.
The first partition in 1772 did not directly threaten the stability of Poland-Lithuania. Poland still retained extensive territory that included the Polish heartlands. In fact, the shock of the annexations made clear the dangers of decay in government institutions, creating a body of opinion favorable to reform along the lines of the European Enlightenment. King Stanislaw August supported the progressive elements in the government and promoted the ideas of foreign political figures such as Edmund Burke and George Washington. At the same time, Polish intellectuals discussed Enlightenment philosophers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau. During the period of Polish Enlightenment, the concept of democratic institutions for all classes was accepted in Polish society. Education reform included establishment of the first ministry of education in Europe. Taxation and the army underwent thorough reform, and government again was centralized in the Permanent Council. Landholders emancipated large numbers of
peasants, although there was no official government decree. Polish cities, in decline for many decades, were revived by the influence of the Industrial Revolution, especially in mining and textiles.

Stanislaw August's process of renovation reached its climax on May 3, 1791, when, after three years of intense debate, the "Four Years' Sejm" produced what is claimed as Europe's first modern codified constitution. Conceived in the liberal spirit of the contemporaneous document in the United States, the constitution recast Poland-Lithuania as a hereditary monarchy and abolished many of the eccentricities and antiquated features of the old system. The new constitution abolished the individual veto in parliament; provided a separation of powers among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government; and established "people's sovereignty" (for the noble and bourgeois classes). Although never fully implemented, the Constitution of May 3 gained an honored position in the Polish political heritage; tradition marks the anniversary of its passage as the country's most important civic holiday.

Destruction of Poland-Lithuania.

Passage of the constitution alarmed nobles who would lose considerable stature under the new order. In autocratic states such as Russia, the democratic ideals of the constitution also threatened the existing order, and the prospect of Polish recovery threatened to end domination of Polish affairs by its neighbors. In 1792 domestic and foreign reactionaries combined to end the democratization process.  Polish conservative factions formed the Confederation of Targowica and appealed for Russian assistance in restoring the status quo. Catherine gladly used this opportunity; enlisting Prussian support, she invaded Poland under the pretext of defending Poland's ancient liberties. The irresolute Stanislaw August capitulated, defecting to the Targowica faction.  Arguing that Poland had fallen prey to the radical Jacobinism then at high tide in France, Russia and Prussia abrogated the Constitution of 3 May, carried out a second partition of Poland in 1793, and placed the remainder of the country under
occupation by Russian troops.

The second partition was far more injurious than the first. Russia received a vast area of eastern Poland, extending southward from its gains in the first partition nearly to the Black Sea. To the west, Prussia received an area known as South Prussia, nearly twice the size of its first-partition gains along the Baltic, as well as the port of Gda sk. Thus, Poland's neighbors reduced the commonwealth to a rump state and plainly signaled their designs to abolish it altogether at their convenience.

In a gesture of defiance, a general Polish revolt broke out in 1794 under the leadership of Tadeusz Kosciuszko (Kosciuszko Uprising), a military officer who had rendered notable service in the American Revolution. Kosciuszko's ragtag insurgent armies won some initial successes, but they eventually fell before the superior forces of Russian General Alexander Suvorov. In the wake of the insurrection of 1794, Russia, Prussia, and Austria carried out the third and final partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1795, erasing the Commonwealth of Two Nations from the map and pledging never to let it return.

Much of Europe condemned the dismemberment as an international crime without
historical parallel. Amid the distractions of the French Revolution and its
attendant wars, however, no state actively opposed the annexations. In the long
term, the dissolution of Poland-Lithuania upset the traditional European

Countersteering is the name given to the counter-intuitive technique used by cyclists and motorcyclists to turn corners. It is the only way a rider can cause a single-track vehicle at speed to turn.

It is important to distinguish between countersteering as a physical phenomenon and countersteering as a rider technique for initiating a turn (the usual interpretation of the term). The physical phenomenon always occurs, because there is no other way to cause the bike and rider to lean short of some outside influence such as an opportune side wind, although at low speeds it can be lost or hidden in the minute corrections made to maintain balance. On the other hand, the technique of applying pressure to the handlebars to initiate a turn is not always necessary, since, on a sufficiently light bike (especially a bicycle), turning can also be initiated by shifting body weight. Documented physical experimentation shows that on heavy bikes (many motorcycles) shifting body weight is ineffective at initiating turns.

How it works.
When riding a bicycle or a motorcycle, countersteering is a method of initiating a turn by a small, momentary turn of the front wheel, usually via the handlebars, in the opposite (counter) direction. While necessary at all speeds, the need to countersteer becomes more noticeable as speed increases.

A bike can negotiate a curve only when it leans towards the inside of the turn, at an angle appropriate for the velocity and the sharpness of the turn. Otherwise centrifugal force will tip the bike and rider over towards the outside of the curve. The transition of riding in a straight line to negotiating a turn is a process of leaning the bike into the turn.

If a rider wants to turn to the right, he first throws the bike off balance by momentarily pointing the front wheel slightly to the left. The center of mass of the bike plus rider will continue in a straight line, but the contact patches of the tires move to the left with respect to this straight line. As gravity then tips the bike over to the right, the front wheel is steered into the curve, and the curve is negotiated with the proper inward lean. This process usually requires little physical effort, because the geometry of the steering system of most bikes is designed in such a way that the front wheel has a strong tendency to steer in the direction of a lean.

At low speeds countersteering is equally necessary, but the countersteering is then so subtle that it drowns in the continuous corrections that are made in balancing the bike.

Once in a turn, countersteering is again required to make changes to its shape. The only way to decrease the radius at the same speed is to increase the lean angle, and the only way to increase the lean angle, is again to momentarily steer opposite to the direction of the curve. To the untrained, this can be extremely counter-intuitive.

To exit a turn, countersteer by momentarily steering further in the direction of the turn. This tilts the bike back upright.

Countersteering is indispensable for bike steering. Most people are not consciously aware that they employ countersteering when riding their bike. Their body has learned to include the well timed countersteering jolt. They may have learned to do so while learning to ride a bicycle in childhood. Often people simply assume that the steering of a bike is just like the steering of a car. Their subconscious balance skills know better.

As is well-known in bicycle racing, the countersteering phenomenon becomes evident when there is an obstacle preventing the wheel from countersteering, e.g., when closely overlapping wheels or riding very close to a curb. In these situations, the only way to initiate a turn away from the obstacle is to come into contact with it, that is, turn towards the wheel or curb in order to avoid crashing into it. Lack of understanding of this principle leads to accidents in novice bicycle races. 

Motorcycles.
Even more so than on a bicycle, mastering the technique of countersteering is essential for safe motorcycle riding, and as a result is a large part of the safe riding courses run by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.  At the higher speeds that motorcycles commonly travel at, it becomes increasingly impractical to steer by taking advantage of the minute and random corrections needed to maintain balance.

Much of the art of motorcycle cornering is learning how to effectively "push" the grips into corners and how to maintain proper lean angles through the turn. When the need for a quick swerve to one side suddenly arises in an emergency, it is essential to know, through prior practice, that the handlebars must be deliberately pressed away on that side instead of being pulled.  Many accidents result when otherwise experienced riders who have never carefully developed this skill encounter an unexpected obstacle.

The Hive is an original Star Wars novella written by Steven Barnes.  It is a prequel novel occurring 21 years before the Battle of Yavin (21 BBY).

Summary.

The Hive follows the story of Obi-Wan Kenobi as he is dispatched as a Republic envoy to the Outer Rim planet Ord Cestus, where he must strive to halt the sale of potentially deadly  bio-droids  to the Confederacy.  Despite the efforts of Obi-Wan, this mission quickly turns from diplomatic to dangerous.  This planet which was at one time self contained, has long since been co-opted by unscrupulous offworlders, whose plunder of a vital natural resource has enabled the rise of a powerful corporation that controls the economy.  Even the native population known as the X Ting have been reduced to mere second class citizens in their own society.

Obi-Wan Kenobi brings with him the knowledge of a legal technicality that would allow the X'Ting to retake control of their planet.  Circumstances within the X'Ting civilization are less than desirable in which to mount such a revival.  This once tightly knit race has splintered into battling factions as a result of a devastating plague, which wiped out many of the X'Ting rulers.  Reunification can only come with the rise of new royals, whom all X Ting are bound by blood to serve. But the eggs that will spawn those sovereigns lie out of reach, secured in a secret chamber and booby-trapped by those whose knowledge died with them in the plague.  Obi-Wan Kenobi and his X'Ting guide, Jesson Di Blinth travel down into the sealed egg chamber in an attempt to retrieve the last remaining royal eggs.  They face many trials along the way, including a question and answer session for the final test.  The questions are presented by a machine that holds the eggs, and threatens vaporization of them if answered incorrectly.  Jesson is the only one who can complete this task because he is X'Ting, and the test seeks to determine one's knowledge of X'Ting history.  Unfortunately, Jesson answers the questions to the best of his knowledge but all are incorrect.  The machine starts the vaporization process, and all Obi-Wan and Jesson can do is sit astonished as the last hope for X'Ting reunification is destroyed.  Unbeknownst to them, this was in fact the final test, to view the reaction of Jesson to determine his true reasons for attempting retrieval of the royal eggs.  The machine is satisfied with his reaction, and releases the eggs to Jesson.

Madhepura is a city and a municipality in Madhepura district in the Indian state of Bihar.

History.
The history of Madhepura is traced back to the reign of Kushan Dynasty of Ancient India. The "Bhant Community" living in Basantpur and Raibhir village under Shankarpur block are the descendants of the Kushan Dynasty. Madhepura was a part of Maurya Dynasty, this fact is asserted by the Mauryan pillar at Uda-kishunganj. A mosque of the time of Akbar is still present in Sarsandi village under Uda-Kishunganj p.s. Which shows its historical importance.
Singheshwarsthan has the religious significance since ancient time as this land was the meditation place of the great Rishi, Shringi. Hence, this place is considered to be the most pious for the Hindus. Sikander Sah had also visited the district, which is evident from the coins discovered from Sahugarh village

Sir Luke William Burke Teeling (5 February, 1903   26 October, 1975) was a British author, traveller and politician. He was known for his enthusiasm for a Channel Tunnel.

Background.
Teeling, who was from a prominent Roman Catholic family, was the son of the Accountant-General of the Irish Supreme Court. One of his great-great-uncles was hanged by the British for taking part in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. He attended the London Oratory School and Magdalen College, Oxford where he studied history.

Journalistic and literary career.
On leaving university, Teeling became a journalist and travelled widely both at home and abroad, especially in the United States where he described himself as an "amateur tramp". He lived among the homeless and hitched lifts on freight trains, reporting back to The Times about his adventures. In the early 1930s he also studied the youth movements in Nazi Germany. In winter 1933 Teeling had walked all the way from London to Newcastle upon Tyne, sleeping in hostels and examining the efforts of local councils to tackle unemployment. 

Another preoccupation when Teeling was travelling abroad was the treatment given to Irish immigrants and to the Catholic Church. In 1937 he wrote "The Pope in Politics" which suggested that Pope Pius XI was opposed to the new forms of Catholicism developing in the Americas. He followed this in 1939 with "Crisis for Christianity", a book which dealt with the relations between the Catholic Church and Nazism.

Parliamentary career.
When the Second World War broke out, Teeling joined the Royal Air Force. Having already fought the safe Labour seat of West Ham Silvertown in the 1929 general election, Teeling was elected to Parliament as a Conservative for Brighton in a 1944 byelection. This was a two-member seat, and Teeling was re-elected in the 1945 general election. The seat was divided into two individual constituencies thereafter, and Teeling was chosen for Brighton Pavilion.

Throughout his Parliamentary career Teeling remained on the backbenches, but his expertise on foreign affairs was acknowledged (he was a Freeman of Seoul in Korea). He was a strong supporter of all attempts to build a tunnel under the English Channel, and chaired an all-party committee which campaigned for it. He was also Secretary of the All-Party committee on Holiday Resorts. He was Knighted in 1962.

Later life.
Teeling resigned in February 1969, owing to ill health. He travelled to Africa to help his recovery. He became Secretary of the Irish Peers Association in June 1970, whose cause he had often promoted.

Maelienydd, sometimes spelt Maeliennydd, was a cantref and lordship in east central Wales covering the area from the River Teme to Radnor Forest and the area around Llandrindod Wells. The area, which is mainly upland, is now in Powys.

Originally an independent kingdom, Maelienydd became an area of great strategic importance after the Norman conquest of England, due to its position. It appears to have come under Norman control before 1093, but during the 12th century became a battleground between the Welsh rulers of the area, notably Cadwallon ap Madog, and the Mortimer family. In 1179 Cadwallon was killed by the retainers of Roger Mortimer when he was returning from the court of King Henry II of England. Mortimer was imprisoned by the king for this and Maelienydd was inherited by Cadwallon's son, Maelgwn ap Cadwallon. On Roger Mortimer's release from prison he seized much of the lordship, though Maelgwn was later able to recover it with the help of Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth. After Rhys' death the Mortimers again took possession.

The struggle for the rule of Maelienydd continued during the 13th century, involving the kings of England and Llywelyn the Great and Llywelyn the Last of Gwynedd. A number of castles were built here, notably Cefnllys Castle and Cymaron Castle. One of the main versions of Welsh law, the Cyfnerth Redaction, is thought to originate from Maelienydd when it was in the sphere of influence of Rhys ap Gruffydd of Deheubarth in the second half of the 12th century.

Maelienydd was one of two cantrefs brought together to form Radnorshire. The name survives for the general area.

<doc id="1187216" title="Christian Michelsen" nonfiltered="255" processed="253" dbindex="1480255">

Peter Christian Hersleb Kjerschow Michelsen (March 15, 1857   June 29, 1925) was a Norwegian shipping magnate and statesman. He was Prime Minister of Norway from 1905 to 1907. Michelsen is most known for his central role in the dissolution of the union between Norway and Sweden in 1905,  and was one of Norway's most influential politicians of his day.

Born in Bergen, Michelsen was a lawyer and ship-owner. He became a member of the Norwegian parliament in 1891, representing the Social Liberal Party. He considered himself mostly above petty party strifes, and one of his major aims was to create a coalition of parties reaching from the Conservative Party to the Social Liberal Party, which he called the United Party. He became a member of Francis Hagerup's cabinet, and was one of the strongest proponents of a more firm policy towards the union between Sweden and Norway. In March 1905, Michelsen replaced Hagerup as Prime Minister, and immediately became the leader of the movement towards dissolution of the union.

The formal basis for the dissolution was King Oscar II's refusal to accept the Norwegian consular laws. The Swedish government had for several years insisted that laws governing foreign affairs had to be a part of the union agreement, and as such, consular laws could not be passed by the Norwegian Storting without consent of the Swedish Riksdag (parliament). The Swedes were willing to accept the Norwegian urge for separate consular affairs, but they demanded that Norway accept the precedent under which the union had operated for 90 years, namely that the Foreign Minister be Swedish. This, the Norwegians felt, acknowledged Sweden as having the upper hand in the Union. While this supremacy existed in reality, Norwegians were unwilling to accept the unequal relationship on a formal, legal basis. 



On May 27, 1905 King Oscar refused to sign the bill, and in response the Norwegian cabinet ministers resigned collectively. The king took no further action, probably aware that a dissolution of the Union was imminent, and the Swedish politicians did nothing, probably believing that this was another Norwegian political retreat. On June 7 the Norwegian Storting declared that because the King had been unable to form a new government in Norway after Michelsen's resignation, he had lost the capacity to rule and hence ceased to be king of Norway. This strategic move gave the dissolution a somewhat legal basis, and was primarily the work of Christian Michelsen. 

He knew that the Norwegian people, after months of well-directed information in a unanimous press, was united in a way that is extremely rare in a democracy. In the referendum that proved the Norwegian will to dissolve the union, retention of the union garnered a mere 184 votes nationwide, which represented only one vote out of every 2000 cast.

Michelsen, though an adherent of a democratic republic in Norway, accepted that a democratic monarchy would have the greatest chances to be accepted abroad and among a majority of Norwegians. Prince Carl of Denmark became King Haakon VII of Norway after a new referendum had given the monarchy proponents approximately 79% of the votes cast. 



In 1906 Michelsen won the election on a "above-the-parties" ticket, which quickly alienated the leading Social Liberals from him. In 1907 he resigned, having tired of petty squabbles among the political leaders, and accepting that his political views had been defeated. Jørgen Løvland carried on Michelsen's work, but lacked the will to force the coalition to stand united, and in 1908 the coalition broke down. Michelsen never reentered politics. Michelsen bequeathed a large part of his fortune to the establishment of a foundation for science and intellectual freedom, that later became the Chr. Michelsen Institute.

His distaste for party politics can be summed in the following quote: "The party congresses are the scene where a number of irresponsible politicians meet to make a tasty stew for the nourishment of their constituents."

In 1905 he was awarded the Grand Cross of The Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and in 1907 he received the Collar as well.

An RNA virus is a virus which belongs to either Group III, Group IV or Group V of the Baltimore classification system of classifying viruses. As such, they possess ribonucleic acid (RNA) as their genetic material and do not replicate using a DNA intermediate. The nucleic acid is usually single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) but can occasionally be double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Notable human pathogenic RNA viruses include SARS, Influenza and Hepatitis C viruses. Walter Fiers (University of Ghent, Belgium) was the first to establish the complete nucleotide sequence of a gene (1972) and of the viral genome of a virus: Bacteriophage MS2-RNA (1976)

Characteristics.
RNA Sense.

RNA viruses can be further classified according to the sense or polarity of their RNA into negative-sense and positive-sense RNA viruses. Positive-sense viral RNA is identical to viral mRNA and thus can be immediately translated by the host cell. Negative-sense viral RNA is complementary to mRNA and thus must be converted to positive-sense RNA by an RNA polymerase before translation. As such, purified RNA of a positive-sense virus can directly cause infection though it may be less infectious than the whole virus particle. Purified RNA of a negative-sense virus is not infectious by itself as it needs to be transcribed into positive-sense RNA.

Mutation rates.
RNA viruses generally have very high mutation rates as they lack DNA polymerases which can find and fix mistakes, and are therefore unable to conduct DNA repair of damaged genetic material. DNA viruses have considerably lower mutation rates due to the proof-reading ability of DNA polymerases within the host cell. Retroviruses integrate a DNA intermediate of their RNA genome into the host genome, and therefore have a higher chance of correcting any mistakes in their genome thanks to the action of proof-reading DNA polymerases belonging to the host cell.

Although RNA usually mutates rapidly, recent work found that the SARS virus and related RNA viruses contain a gene that mutates very slowly. The gene in question has a complex three-dimensional structure which is hypothesized to provide a chemical function necessary for viral propagation, perhaps as a ribozyme. If so, most mutations would render it unfit for that purpose and would not propagate.

 Replication .
Animal RNA viruses can be placed into about four different groups depending on their mode of replication.

Positive-sense viruses have their genome directly utilized as if it were mRNA, producing a single protein which is modified by host and viral proteins to form the various proteins needed for replication. One of these includes RNA replicase, which copies the viral RNA to form a double-stranded replicative form, in turn this directs the formation of new virions.
Negative-sense viruses must have their genome copied by a RNA polymerase or transcriptase to form positive-sense RNA. This positive-sense RNA molecule acts as viral mRNA, which is translated into proteins by the host ribosomes. The resultant protein goes on to direct the synthesis of new virions, such as capsid proteins and RNA replicase, which is used to produce new negative-sense RNA molecules.
Double-stranded reoviruses contain up to a dozen different RNA molecules which each code for a mRNA. These all associate with proteins to form a single large complex which is replicated using virally-encoded replicase to form new virions.
Retroviruses are single-stranded but unlike other single-stranded RNA viruses they use DNA intermediates to replicate.  Reverse transcriptase, a viral enzyme that comes from the virus itself after it is uncoated, converts the viral RNA into a complementary strand of DNA, which is copied to produce a double stranded molecule of viral DNA. This DNA goes on to direct the formation of new virions.

<doc id="31621" title="Transient ischemic attack" nonfiltered="261" processed="259" dbindex="1480261">


A transient ischemic attack (TIA, often colloquially referred to as "mini stroke") is caused by the temporary disturbance of blood supply to a restricted area of the brain, resulting in brief neurologic dysfunction that usually persists for less than 24 hours. 

 Symptoms .
Symptoms vary widely from person to person depending on the area of the brain involved. The most frequent symptoms include temporary loss of vision (typically amaurosis fugax), difficulty speaking (dysarthria), weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis), numbness usually on one side of the body, and loss of consciousness. If there are neurological symptoms persisting for more than 24 hours, it is classified as a cerebrovascular accident (stroke).

 Prognosis .
Patients diagnosed with a TIA are sometimes said to have had a warning for an approaching cerebrovascular accident. If the time period of blood supply impairment lasts more than a few minutes, the nerve cells of that area of the brain die and cause permanent neurologic deficit. One third of the people with TIA later have recurrent TIAs and one third have a stroke due to permanent nerve cell loss.

Causes.
The most common cause of a TIA is an embolus (a small blood clot) that occludes an artery in the brain. This most frequently arises from an atherosclerotic plaque in one of the carotid arteries (i.e. a number of major arteries in the head and neck) or from a thrombus (i.e. a blood clot) in the heart due to atrial fibrillation.

Other reasons include excessive narrowing of large vessels due to an atherosclerotic plaque and increased blood viscosity due to some blood diseases. TIA is related with other medical conditions like hypertension, heart disease (especially atrial fibrillation), migraine, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus.

Treatment.
The mainstay of treatment following acute recovery from a TIA should be to diagnose and treat the underlying cause.  It is not always immediately possible to tell the difference between a CVA (stroke) and a TIA.  Most patients who are diagnosed at a hospital's Accident & Emergency Department as having suffered from a TIA will be discharged home and advised to contact their primary physician to organize further investigations.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) may show atrial fibrillation, a common cause of TIAs, or other arrhythmias that may cause embolisation to the brain. An echocardiogram is useful in detecting thrombus within the heart chambers. Such patients benefit from anticoagulation. 

If the TIA affects an area supplied by the carotid artery, an ultrasound scan may demonstrate carotid stenosis. For people with a greater than 70% stenosis within the carotid artery, removal of atherosclerotic plaque by surgery, specifically a carotid endarterectomy, may be recommended.

Some patients may also be given modified release dipyridamole or clopidogrel.

Measurement of traffic within a network allows network managers and analysts to both make day-to-day decisions about operations and to plan for long-term developments 2. Traffic Measurements are used in many fundamental activities such as :

Identification of traffic patterns and trends ;
Calculating the traffic intensity in a specific circuit or group;
Monitoring the service;
Dimensioning and managing the network;
Calculating tariffs;
Performing forecasting;
Dimensioning and managing the SS7network;
Checking the performance of the common channel signalling network;

The following sections will answer some fundamental questions about Traffic Measurement, such as: What should be measured; when should it be measured; what assumptions are made; and what errors can occur?

When should traffic be measured?.

Traffic Measurements are conducted on a continuous basis and the results compiled into reports for management which are used in management decisions on various time scales. Measurements that are taken every few minutes are used for network management and temporary routing, measurements every few hours, days and weeks are used for maintenance purposes and measurements that are taken over months or even years are used for long-term network deployment, upgrading and extensions .

To determine normal reference traffic for a network, the ITU recommends that a network traffic analyst must take measurements for the busiest hour of each day for a whole year . The busiest hour is defined as that four consecutive quarter hours whose traffic intensity is the greatest. Measurements taken outside the busy hour can be discarded. The reference intensity of traffic is then calculated by taking the average traffic intensity of the top thirty days in the year . Measurements taken on individual days can be discarded. This will give the normal high traffic intensity in the network, allowing network managers to make long-term strategic decisions .

Assumptions made when calculating circuits required.

To perform calculations in circuit-switched networks several assumptions are made :

Calls arrivals follow a Poisson distribution ;
Holding times follow a Negative Exponential distribution ;
Blocked calls are lost or overflow ;
There is statistical equilibrium;

It is useful to remember that the measurements are averages and this process deliberately ignores very short term variations in the traffic, but still allowing for a small but finite loss. The above assumptions are accurate if applied to circuit switched networks however they fail when planning for data traffic, small exchanges and sudden sharp peaks in traffic such as that caused by TV and radio phone-in competitions.

Traffic measurement errors.

Measurement errors are caused by faults in equipment or constraints on equipment design. The following five errors are examples of some types of errors that can occur :

Post-processing errors   These errors are generated by operators when analysing data that has been measured;
Pre-processing errors   These errors are generated by computers when compiling data for operators;
Statistical errors   These errors are caused by the averages in traffic measurements and by the fact that measurements are made from discrete samples ;
Database errors   These errors exist when errors are generated by faults in the storage of information;
Interpretation errors   These errors occur when analysts misinterpret data;

Cannonball Blitz was a game released in the early 1980s by Sierra On-Line (then known as "On-Line Systems") for Apple II computers.  The game is essentially a Donkey Kong knock-off, although the game substituted cannonballs and cannons for barrels and replaced the large ape with a soldier.  Also, on the first level, instead of trying to rescue a girl, your character catches a flag.

Although Cannonball Blitz attempted to put a different spin on the Donkey Kong style of gameplay (such as replacing ladders with teeter-totters in the first level, so a falling cannonball would send you to the next floor), the game is marred by frustrating and inflexible gameplay.  For one, your character has a much smaller jumping height than Mario from Donkey Kong, making it much harder to clear obstacles (and much easier for your character to die).

Another criticism is that there were only three different levels. The third level was particularly challenging. However, after completing the third level, the player would view a small celebration scene and then restart at the first level. This repeat of levels differed from the first round by changing up the timing patterns on the gameplay. It was very frustrating to complete the third level and realize that the game only had three levels.

Menckeneanea: A Schimpflexikon is a collection of articles and quotations denouncing H. L. Mencken, collected and arranged by Mencken himself. 

The word  schimpflexikon  is from the German language, which Mencken spoke fluently; it means, roughly, a dictionary of disgrace.  

Since Mencken was, in his day and later, a highly controversial figure, many of the quotations in the book are highly vituperative.  

Among the writers quoted or excerpted is William Allen White.  

The book was printed in a very small edition, and is considered a rarity today.

<doc id="2136" title="Angles" nonfiltered="269" processed="267" dbindex="1480270">




The Angles is a modern English word for a Germanic-speaking people who took their name from the cultural ancestor of Angeln, a modern district located in Schleswig, Germany. Ancient Angeln preceded all modern national distinctions and was probably not coterminous with the modern. For more information, see under Angeln. 

Evolution of the name.
The ethnic name has had various spellings. The earliest attested is Anglii, a Germanic tribe mentioned in the Germania of Tacitus. It is an adjectival form. One individual of this identity would be an Anglius (male) or an Anglia (female), which in the plural is Anglii or Angliae. The masculine is used for the generic form.

The noun from which this adjective was produced remains unknown for certain. The stem would have had the form *Ang?l/r-. Etymology theories have been:-
 From Latin angulus = "angle".
 From the Germanic god Ingwaz and the Ingvaeones federation of which the Angles were part. (the initial vowel could as well be "e" or "a").
 It may refer to fishing by the method called angling.
 The Old English word for the district of Angeln (where the Angles may have come from) on the Baltic is Angel.
 It may mean "the people who dwell by the Narrow Water (i.e. the Schlei)", from the Proto-Indo-European language root ang- meaning "narrow".

Pope Gregory the Great is the first known to have simplified Anglii to Angli, the preferred form for the Anglii in Britain, which he did in an epistle. The country remained Anglia in Latin. Meanwhile, English had changed its vowels. Alfred's Orosius uses Angelcynn (kin) for England or the English people; Bede, Angelfolc (folk); however, we also find Engel, Englan (the people), Englaland and Englisch.

 Early history  .
Angles under other names.

Two important geographers, Strabo and Pliny, are silent concerning the Angles. They both use the excuse that the south shore of the Baltic is terra incognita, "unknown land." They both go on to describe that shore, however. As the Angles took a geographic name, they must have had others not based on geography. The two silent geographers can help us with this question.

The knowledge of neither one of them predates Tacitus by very long. Strabo's mention of the Battle of Teutoburg Forest places his securely to the final years of Augustus' reign and after; i.e., the early first century.

Strabo (7.2.1, 4 and 7.3.1) states that the Cimbri still live on the peninsula (Jutland) where they always did, even though some of them liked to wander. Beyond the Elbe the coastal people are unknown, but south of them are the Suebi from the Elbe to the Getae (Goths). Strabo was moving in his mind eastward from the Rhine.

Pliny on the other hand moved mentally from east to west (4.13.94). His description leaves the Black Sea, crosses the Ripaei mountains to the shore of the northern ocean, and follows it westward to Cadiz. In this direction, before Germania is Scythia, where the Sarmati, Venedi, Sciri and Hirri are located, as far as the Vistula. 

Then the Inguaeones begin. Baunonia (Bornholm) is an island opposite Scythia. We arrive at Cylipenus, probably the Bay of Kiel, and from there to another gulf, Lagnus, which is on the frontier of the Cimbri. Its location is not known, but it must have been in the Angeln region.

In Pliny the Inguaeones consisted of the Cimbri and the Teutones (the Chauci as well, but they were not in this region). If Lagnus was on the Cimbrian frontier and was after Kiel then Angeln must have been in the territory of the Teutones. They were perhaps not named Angles at that time; however, the territory of the Teutones probably included the Propommern and the region south to the Elbe (mainly Holstein), accounting for the implied larger range of the people called Angles in later sources.

The Anglii of Tacitus.

Possibly the first instance of the Angles in recorded history is in Tacitus' Germania, chapter 40, in which the Anglii are mentioned in passing in a list of Germanic tribes.  He gives no precise indication of their geographical position, but states that, together with six other tribes, they worshipped a goddess named Nerthus, whose sanctuary was situated on "an island in the Ocean."  

The other tribes are the Reudigni, Aviones, Varini, Eudoses, Suarini and Nuitones, which are together described as being behind ramparts of rivers and woods; that is, inaccessible to attack. As the Eudoses are the Jutes, these names probably refer to localities in Jutland or the Baltic coast; i.e., they are all Cimbri or Teutones. The coast contains sufficient estuaries, inlets, rivers, islands, swamps and marshes to have been then inaccessible to those not familiar with the terrain, such as the Romans, who just wrote it off as unknown and inaccessible country.

At the present time the majority of scholars believe that the Anglii had lived from the beginning on the coasts of the Baltic, probably in the southern part of the Jutish peninsula.  The evidence for this view is derived partly from English and Danish traditions dealing with persons and events of the 4th century (see below), and partly from the fact that striking affinities to the cult of Nerthus as described by Tacitus are to be found in Scandinavian, especially Swedish and Danish, religion.  

Investigations in this subject have rendered it very probable that the island of Nerthus was Sjælland (Zealand), and it is further to be observed that the kings of Wessex traced their ancestry ultimately to a certain Scyld, who is clearly to be identified with Skiöldr, the mythical founder of the Danish royal family (Skiöldungar).  In English tradition this person is connected with "Scedeland" (pl.), i.e. Scandinavia, while in Scandinavian tradition he is specially associated with the ancient royal residence at Leire in Sjælland.

The account in Germania is contradictory to that of the silent geographers in at least one major point. Tacitus viewed the Baltic as the Suebian Sea and lists the seven tribes above as being in Suebian territory. The Suebi were among the Herminones of central Germany. And yet Pliny, who is just as creditable, accounts for the Teutones as being Inguaeones, the Ingaevones of Tacitus. In Strabo, the Suebi are to the south of the coast. The Suebian language went on to become Old High German, while the Angles and Jutes were among the speakers of Old Saxon.

An explanation no doubt existed, whether one of the authors misunderstood or the distribution of tribes in the 1st century resulted from an overlay of different historical schemes. At this time there is no verifiable answer to the question and no good reason for forcing an answer by excluding evidence.

The Suevi Angili.
Ptolemy in his Geography (2.10), half a century later, presents a somewhat more complex view, as might have been expected. The Saxons are now around the lower Elbe, to which they could have gotten merely by an extension of the Saxon alliance. East of them we find not only the Teutones but a dissimilation of them, the Teutonoari, which has an -oari suffix denoting "men" (wer); i.e., "the Teuton men." These Teutons or Teuton men appear to have been in Angeln and the land around it.

The Angles as such are not listed at all. Instead we find some Syeboi Angeilloi , Latinized to Suevi Angili, located south of the middle Elbe. Owing to the uncertainty of this passage there has been much speculation regarding the original home of the Angli. One theory, which however has little to recommend it, is that they dwelt in the basin of the Saale (in the neighbourhood of the canton Engilin), from which region the Lex Angliorum et Werinorum hoc est Thuringorum is believed by  many to have come.

A second solution is that these Angles of Ptolemy are not the ones of Schleswig at all. According to Julius Pokorny the Angri- in Angrivarii, the -angr in Hardanger and the Angl- in Anglii all come from the same root meaning "bend", but in different senses; in other words, the similarity of the names is strictly coincidental and does not reflect any ethnic unity beyond Germanic. The Suevi Angeli would have been in Lower Saxony or near it and, like Ptolemy's Suevi Semnones, were among the Suebi at the time.

The Angli of Bede.

Bede states that the Angli before they came to Great Britain dwelt in a land called Angulus, and similar evidence is given by the Historia Brittonum. King Alfred the Great and the chronicler Æthelweard identified this place with the district that is now called Angeln, in the province of Schleswig (Slesvig), though it may then have been of greater extent, and this identification agrees very well with the indications given by Bede. Full confirmation is afforded by English and Danish traditions relating to two kings named Wermund and Offa, from whom the Mercian royal family were descended, and whose exploits are connected with Angeln, Schleswig and Rendsburg. Danish tradition has preserved record of two governors of Schleswig, father and son, in their service, Frowinus (Freawine) and Wigo (Wig), from whom the royal family of Wessex claimed descent. During the 5th century the Angli invaded Great Britain, after which time their name does not recure on the continent except in the title of the code mentioned above.

The province of Schleswig has proved exceptionally rich in prehistoric antiquities that date apparently from the 4th and 5th centuries A.D. Among the places where these have been found, special mention should be made of the large cremation cemetery at Borgstedterfeld, between Rendsburg and Eckernförde, which has yielded many urns and brooches closely resembling those found in heathen graves in England. Of still greater importance are the great deposits at Thorsberg moor (in Angeln) and Nydam, which contained large quantities of arms, ornaments, articles of clothing, agricultural implements, &c., and in the latter case even ships. By the help of these discoveries, we are able to reconstruct a fairly detailed picture of Angle civilization in the age preceding the invasion of Great Britain.

 Angle influence in Great Britain .

According to sources such as the Bede, after the invasion of Great Britain, the Angles split up and founded the kingdoms of the Nord Angelnen (Northumbria), Ost Angelnen (East Anglia), and the Mittlere Angelnen (Mercia). Thanks to the major influence of the Saxons, the tribes were collectively called Anglo-Saxons by the Normans.  A region of England is still known as East Anglia. 

The center of the Angle homeland in the north-eastern portion of the modern German bundesland of Schleswig-Holstein, itself on the Jutland Peninsula, is where the rest of that people stayed, a small peninsular form still called Angeln today and is formed as a triangle drawn roughly from modern Flensburg on the Flensburger Fjord to the City of Schleswig and then to Maasholm, on the Schlei inlet.  

In any case, this small and relatively easterly geographic localisation of the original Angeln tribal group has led to one of the Anglo-Saxon Invasion's enduring mysteries: how it is possible that the Anglo-Saxons were so frequently mentioned as colonisers of ancient Great Britain in all the ancient and medieval written sources, while evidence of the neighbouring and much more powerful Frisians' concurrent colonising activities in Great Britain has been so limited to discoveries in archeological science, and more often to logical deductions and inferences alone?  Of course, ethnic Frisians are known to have inhabited the land directly in the path of any migration route from Angeln to Great Britain (except for the long and difficult route by sea around the northern tip of Denmark), and, in fact, they also inhabited lands between the ancient Saxon domain and Great Britain; yet they are rarely mentioned as having taken part in the vast migration.

 St. Gregory .
The Angles are the subject of a legend about Pope Gregory I (ca. 540 604 A.D.).  As an abbreviated version of the story goes, Gregory happened to see a group of Angle children from Deira for sale as slaves in the Roman market.  Struck by the beauty of their fair-skinned complexions and bright blue eyes, Gregory inquired about their background.  When  told they were Angles, he replied with a Latin pun that translates well into English:  Non Angli, sed angeli  ("Not Angles, but angels").  Supposedly, he thereafter resolved to convert their pagan homeland to Christianity.

<doc id="189181" title="Tony Cragg" nonfiltered="270" processed="268" dbindex="1480272">

Tony Cragg (born 1949) is a British-born sculptor.

Cragg was born in Liverpool, following a period of work as a laboratory technician, he first studied art on the foundation course at the Gloucestershire College of Art and Design, Cheltenham and then at the Wimbledon School of Art1969-1973. During this period he was taught by Roger Ackling, who introduced him to the sculptors Richard Long and Bill Woodrow. He completed his studies at Royal College of Art1973-1977 where he was a contemporary of Richard Wentworth. He left Britain in 1977 and moved to Wuppertal in Germany, where he has lived and worked since. 

Many of Cragg's early works are made from found materials and discarded construction materials and disposed househol materials. This gave him a large range of mainly man-made materials and automatically provided him with the thematic concerns that became characteristic of his work up to the present. During the 1970's he made sculptures using simple making techniques like stacking, splitting and crushing. In 1978 he collected discarded plastic fragments and arranged them into colour categories. The first work of this kind was called 'New Stones-Newtons Tones'. Shortly after this he made works on the floor and wall reliefs which created images. One of these works , Britain Seen From the North (1981), features the shape of the island of Great Britain on the wall, oriented so that north is to the left. To the left of the island is the figure of a man, apparently Cragg himself, looking at the country from the position of an outsider. The whole piece is made from broken pieces of found rubbish and is often interpreted as commenting on the economic difficulties Britain was going through at that time which had a particular effect on the north.

Later, Cragg used more traditional materials, such as wood, bronze  and marble, often making simple forms from them, such as test tubes.

Cragg won the Turner Prize in 1988.

Leopold Skulski (15 November 1878-after 1939, likely in 1940) was prime minister of Poland from 1919 to 1920. 

He was involved in politics from at least the mid 1910s, and served as mayor of  ód  between 1917 an 1919. He became a deputy in the Polish parliament (Sejm) after the 1919 elections, and on 13 December 1919 he became the Prime Minister of Poland. His government resigned on 9 June, in the aftermath of the failure of the Kiev Offensive and the success of the Bolshevik counteroffensive. He was also the Minister of Foreign Affairs under the government of Wincenty Witos (from 24 July 1920 to 28 June 1921). He was a member of the State Tribunal of Poland from 1925. President of the Polish Radio in the 1930s, he did not take an active role in political life in the last decade of his life. During the Invasion of Poland he was arrested in Pi sk by the Soviet NKVD; shortly thereafter he died in the NKVD prison in Brze   Litewski.

This article is about the mythological figure, for other uses see Meleager (disambiguation).;

In Greek mythology, Meleager (Greek:          ) was the son of Althaea and Oeneus and, according to some accounts father of Parthenopeus and Polydora. His story has similarities with the Scandinavian Norna-Gests þáttr.

When Meleager was born, the Moirae (the Fates) predicted he would only live until a brand, burning in the family hearth, was consumed by fire.  Althaea immediately doused and hid the brand.  Meleager married Cleopatra, daughter of Idas.  However, in some versions, he had to win Atalanta in a footrace, which was aided by Athena.

Oeneus sent Meleager to gather up heroes to hunt the Calydonian Boar that had been stalking the area.  Among many others, he chose Atalanta, a fierce huntress, whom he loved.  According to one account of the hunt, Hylaeus and Rhaecus, two centaurs, tried to rape Atalanta. Meleager killed them. 

Then, Atalanta wounded the boar and Meleager killed it.  He awarded her the hide since she had drawn the first drop of blood.  

Toxeus and Plexippus (Althaea's brothers) grew enraged that the prize was given to a woman.  Meleager killed them in the following argument.  He also killed Iphicles and Eurypylus for insulting Atalanta.




Since Meleager had killed her two brothers, Althaea placed the brand back upon the fire, killing him.  Later, Meleager was one of the Argonauts.  This may, or may not, have been the same Meleager.  With Atalanta, Meleager may have been the father of Parthenopeus, although in other versions Hippomenes was his father.

Stavies (in Greek "       ") is  a small village near the southern part of Crete, Greece. This village is built at a height of 240 m above sea-level, on the south edge of the valley of Messara and is mentioned in the Archives of Chandax in 1370. It is possible that the name Stavies has its origin in the Italian name Stavia, a town destroyed in the eruption of the Vesuvio in 79 AD. After the destruction of their village, refugees could have landed in Crete and built the present village.

It belongs to the municipiality of Kofina and nearby villages are Fournofarago, Dionysi and Vagionia. Its population approximates to 300 persons. The area is mainly agricultural and a large variety of high quality products are produced. Some of which are the famous Cretan Olive Oil and various products of grapes like wine, raisins and a local alcoholic drink named Raki ("    ").

<doc id="192503" title="Hans Memling" nonfiltered="281" processed="279" dbindex="1480283">


Hans Memling (Memlinc) (c. 1430 - 11 August, 1494) was a Flemish painter, born in Germany, who was the last major fifteenth century artist in the Netherlands, the successor to Jan van Eyck and Rogier van der Weyden , whose tradition he continued with little innovation. 

Life and works.
Born in Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt in the Middle Rhein region, Memling probably served his apprenticeship at Mainz or Cologne, and later worked in the Netherlands under Rogier van der Weyden (c. 1455-60). He did not come to Bruges until about 1465. A story telling that he was a wounded fugitive from the battle of Nancy is fiction, as is also the report that he was sheltered and cured by the Hospitallers at Bruges, and, to show his gratitude, refused payment for a picture he had painted. Memling did indeed paint for the Hospitallers, but he painted not one but many pictures, and he did so in 1479 and 1480, being probably known to his patrons of St John by many masterpieces even before the battle of Nancy.

Memling is only connected with military operations in a mediate and distant sense. His name appears on a list of subscribers to the loan which was raised by Maximilian of Austria (Maximilian I), to crush hostilities against France in the year 1480. In 1477, when he is falsely said to have fallen, and when Charles the Bold was killed, he was under contract to furnish an altarpiece for the gild-chapel of the booksellers of Bruges; and
this altarpiece, now reserved, under the name of the Seven Griefs of Mary,
in the Gallery of Turin, is one of the fine creations of his riper age, and not
inferior in any way to those of 1479 in the hospital of St John, which for
their part are hardly less interesting as illustrative of the master's power
than The Last Judgment in the cathedral of the Hanse city Gda sk (Danzig), Poland. Critical opinion has
been unanimous in assigning the altarpiece of Gda sk to Memling; and by this it
affirms that Memling was a resident and a skilled artist at Bruges in 1473; for the Last Judgment was undoubtedly painted and sold to a merchant
at Bruges, who shipped it there on board of a vessel bound to the Mediterranean,
which was captured by a Gda sk privateer, Paúel Benecke, in that very year. But, in order that
Memling's repute should be so fair as to make his pictures purchasable, as this
had been, by an agent of the Medici at Bruges, it is incumbent on us to
acknowledge that he had furnished sufficient proofs before that time of the
skill which excited the wonder of such highly cultivated patrons.



It is characteristic that the oldest allusions to pictures connected with
Memling's name are those which point to relations with the Burgundian court.
The inventories of Margaret of Austria, drawn up in 1524, allude to a triptych
of the God of Pity by Roger van der Weyden, of which the wings containing angels were by Master Hans. But this entry is less important as affording testimony in favour of the preservation of Memling's work than as showing his connection with an older Flemish craftsman. For ages Roger van der Weyden was acknowledged as an artist of the school of Bruges, until records of undisputed authenticity demonstrated that he was bred at Tournai and settled at Brussels. Nothing seems more natural than the conjunction of his name with that of
Memling as the author of an altarpiece, since, though Memling's youth remains obscure, it is clear from the style of his manhood that he was taught in the painting-room of Van der Weyden. Nor is it beyond the limits of probability that it was Van der Weyden who received commissions at a distance from Brussels, and first took his pupil to Bruges, where he afterwards dwelt. The clearest evidence of the connexion of the two masters is that afforded by pictures, particularly an altarpiece, which has alternately been assigned to each of them, and which may possibly be due to, their joint labours. In this altarpiece, which is a triptych ordered for a patron of the house of Sforza, we find the style of Van der Weyden in the central panel of the Crucifixion, and that of Memling in the episodes on the wings. Yet the whole piece was assigned to the former in the Zambeccari collection at Bologna, whilst it was attributed
to the latter at the Middleton sale in London in 1872. At first, we may think, a closer resemblance might be traced between the two artists than that disclosed in later works of Memling, but the delicate organization of the younger painter, perhaps also a milder appreciation of the duties of a Christian artist, may have led Memling to realise a sweet and perfect ideal, without losing, on that account, the feeling of his master. He certainly exchanged the asceticism of Van der Weyden for a sentiment of less energetic concentration. He softened his teacher's asperities and bitter hardness of expression.

In the oldest form in which Memling's style is displayed, or rather in that example which represents the Baptist in the gallery of Munich, we are supposed to contemplate an effort of the year 1470. The finish of this piece is scarcely surpassed, though the subject is more important, by that of the Last Judgment in Gda sk.

But the latter is more interesting than the former, because it tells how Memling, long after Roger's death and his own settlement at Bruges, preserved the traditions of sacred art which had been applied in the first part of the century by Rogier van der Weyden to the Last Judgment of Beaune. All that Memling did was to purge his master's manner of excessive stringency, and add to his other qualities a velvet softness of pigment, a delicate transparence of colours, and yielding grace of slender forms. That such a beautiful work as the Last Judgment of Gda sk should have been bought for the Italian market is not surprising when we recollect that picture-fanciers in that country were familiar with the beauties of Memling's compositions, as shown in the preference given to them by such purchasers as Cardinal Grimari and Cardinal Bembo at Venice, and the heads of the house of Medici at Florence.



But Memling's reputation was not confined to Italy or Flanders. The Madonna and Saints which passed out of the Duchatel collection into the gallery of the Louvre, the Virgin and Child painted for Sir John Donne and now at the National Gallery, London, and other noble specimens in English and Continental private houses, show that his work was as widely known and appreciated in the 16th century.

It was perhaps not their sole attraction that they gave the most tender and delicate possible impersonations of the Mother of Christ that could suit the taste of that age in any European country. But the portraits of the donors, with which they were mostly combined, were more characteristic, and probably more remarkable as likenesses, than any that Memling s contemporaries could produce. Nor is it unreasonable to think that his success as a portrait painter, which is manifested in isolated busts as well as in altarpieces, was of a kind to react with effect on the Venetian school, which undoubtedly was affected by the partiality of Antonello da Messina for trans-Alpine types studied in Flanders in Memling's time. The portraits of Sir John Donne and his wife and children in the National Gallery, London altarpiece are also remarkable as models of drawing and finish than as refined presentations of persons of distinction; nor is any difference in this respect to be found in the splendid groups of father, mother, and children which fill the noble altarpiece of the Louvre. As single portraits, the busts of Burgomaster Moreel and his wife in the museum of Brussels, and their
daughter the Sibyl Zambetha (according to the added description) in the hospital at Bruges, are the finest and most interesting of specimens. The Seven Griefs of Mary in the gallery of Turin, to which we may add the Seven Joys of Mary in the Pinakothek of Munich, are illustrations of the habit which clung to the art of Flanders of representing a cycle of subjects on the different planes of a single picture, where a wide expanse of ground is covered with incidents from the Passion in the form common to the action of sacred plays.

The masterpiece of Memling's later years, a shrine containing relics of St Ursula in the museum of the hospital of Bruges, is fairly supposed to have been ordered and finished in 1480. The delicacy of finish in its miniature figures, the variety of its landscapes and costume, the marvellous patience with which its details are given, are all matters of enjoythent to the spectator. There is later work of the master in the St Christopher and Saints of 1484 in the academy, or the Newenhoven Madonna in the hospital of Bruges, or a large Crucifixion, with scenes from the Passion, of 1491 from the Lübeck Cathedral (Dom) of Lübeck, now in Lübeck's St. Annen Museum. But as we near the close of Memling's career we observe that his practice has become larger than he can compass alone; and, as usual in such cases, the labour of disciples is substituted for his own. The registers of the painters' corporation at Bruges give the names of two apprentices who served their time with Memling and paid dues on admission to the gild in 1480 and 1486. These subordinates remained obscure.

The trustees of his will appeared before the court of wards at Bruges on December 10, 1495, and we gather from records of that date and place that Memling left behind several children and a considerable property.










Passion Altarpiece/Polyptych (1491) in Lübeck



Critical opinions.
 Erwin Panofsky in his 1953 Early Netherlandish Painting (p.347) says of Memling, rather harshly: "...while the Romantics and the Victorians considered his sweetness the very summit of Medieval art, we feel inclined to compare him to a composer such as Felix Mendelssohn: he occasionally enchants, never offends, and never overwhelms.  His works give the impression of derivativeness...";

<doc id="2385420" title="Triosephosphate isomerase" nonfiltered="282" processed="280" dbindex="1480284">



Triose-phosphate isomerase (TPI or TIM), is an enzyme () that catalyzes the reversible interconversion of triose phosphates isomers dihydroxyacetone phosphate and D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.




Triose phosphate isomerase (TPI) plays an important role in glycolysis and is essential for efficient energy production. TPI has been found in every organism searched for the enzyme, including animals such as mammals and insects as well as in funghi, plants and bacteria.

In humans, deficiencies in TPI are associated with with a progressive, severe neurological disorder called Triose Phosphate Isomerase deficiency.

Triose phosphate isomerase is a massively efficient enzyme, performing the reaction billions of times faster than it would naturally in solution. The reaction is so efficient it is limited by the rate the substrate can diffuse into the enzyme's active site.

Structure.
Triose phosphate isomerase is a dimer of identical subunits, each of which is made up of about 250 amino acid residues. The three-dimensional structure of a subunit contains eight -helices (blue and red) on the outside and eight parallel -strands on the inside (violet and yellow). This structural motif is called an   -barrel, or a TIM-barrel, and is by far the most commonly observed protein fold. The active site of this enzyme is in the center of the barrel. A glutamic acid residue is involved in the catalytic mechanism.  The sequence around the active site residue is conserved in all known triose phosphate isomerases.

<doc id="3695489" title="Mike Dorsey" nonfiltered="286" processed="284" dbindex="1480288">

Mike Dorsey (born 1930 in Yorkshire, United Kingdom) was an Australia-based theatre and television actor best known for his long-running role of Reg MacDonald in the 1970s television soap opera Number 96. 

Dorsey's acting career began in the late 1940s when he started acting with the Gate Theatre, Dublin, in bit parts. After three years in the army in the early 1950s Dorsey returned to acting, with several minor stage roles on the UK provincial theatre circuit. The scarcity of acting work led to a career change to the publicity business, and Dorsey subsequently did the publicity in London for such performers as Kenny Ball, Acker Bilk and The Yardbirds. He later did two tours with The Rolling Stones, one of which brought him to Australia where he decided to settle in 1965.

In Australia Dorsey's career as an actor and performer quickly took off. Beginning in the mid 1960s he had several guest starring roles in Australian drama series including Riptide, Skippy the Bush Kangaroo, and many appearances in the various Crawford Productions police drama series. During this period he also played the on-going role of Captain Roke in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation-Artransa Films science fiction children's series Phoenix 5 (1970), was the straight man on Joe Martin's show Tonight on Channel Ten, and had a brief role as a police detective in Number 96 in 1972.

Beginning in January 1974 Dorsey played the regular role of comedy character Reg "Daddy" MacDonald in Number 96. An officious bureaucrat with the local council, buttoned-down Reg lived a regimented life and liked to speak in acronyms as a sort of verbal shorthand. He would frequently register his indignation with signature phrase "Great Scott!" Along with wife Edie - otherwise known as "Mother" or "Mummy" - (Wendy Blacklock) and daughter Marilyn (Frances Hargreaves) the character became a hit with viewers.

In late 1976 there were plans to spinoff the characters of Mummy and Daddy into a new situation comedy series titled Mummy and Me and starring Dorsey and Blacklock, but the proposed series was not picked up by the network and the characters remained in Number 96. Dorsey and Blacklock played in Number 96 continuously until it ended in August 1977, surviving several drastic cast purges during the show's closing months.

After the series ended, Dorsey, like many of his former Number 96 co-stars, had a guest starring role in school-based drama Glenview High (1977). In the late 1970s Dorsey and his main Number 96 co-star Wendy Blacklock created a stage show based on their Number 96 characters which toured clubs in New South Wales over a period of nearly two years. In 1978-1979 Dorsey played an on-going role on hospital-based soap opera The Young Doctors. He then took the regular role of Vic Marshall in Network Ten daily soap opera Arcade (1980), a notorious critical and popular failure cancelled after being on air only six weeks. Dorsey subsequently ran a theatrical group. 

Today he is retired and living in Rockingham, Western Australia but is still in demand as a voice-over artist and actor.

McCann Field House is a 3,100-seat multi-purpose arena in Poughkeepsie, New York. It was built in 1977 and is home to the Marist College Red Foxes men's and women's basketball and women's volleyball teams.

The Field House's namesake James J. McCann (1880-1969), a Poughkeepsie native, was a strong Marist Athletic  supporter and avid sportsman. Generous support from his charitable trust made possible the construction of the Field House. 

A maple floor was originally donated by former NBA All-Star Rik Smits ('87) for use by his alma mater. Following an accidental soaking of the court by a fire sprinkler, Smits re-donated a new court. A display honoring Smits, including an Indiana Pacers jersey, can be found next to the basketball court.

In 2005 approval was given for a $150,000 seating improvement project that will enrich the quality of seating along both baselines for Red Fox fans. This project will feature enhanced seating along the North baseline and an imposing 19-foot high student section along the south baseline. When completed, the student section and pep band will have seats located less than 6 feet from the baseline, creating an imposing and loud student section. An additional capital improvement slated for the 2005 season is the introduction of a 40-foot NBA style scorer's table.

The Northeast Conference men's basketball tournament was held there in 1984 and 1987.

The humpback angler, Melanocetus johnsonii, is a black seadevil of the family Melanocetidae, found in tropical to temperate parts of all oceans at depths of up to 2,000 m.  Its length is up to 3 cm for males and up to 20 cm for females.

Female humpback anglers have an enormous head dominated by a cavernous mouth full of long slender teeth that can fold backwards when prey is being swallowed.  The belly is distensible and this, along with the huge gape of the mouth, allows them to swallow fishes up to twice their own length.  Their eyes are small and covered by a thin layer of skin, and between them arises a large lure which is actually a modified first dorsal fin ray.

Males are free swimming when young but before they mature these small fishes (about a tenth the size of the female) attach themselves permanently to the hind body of the female and become parasitic. Their blood supply becomes continuous with that of the female and most of the internal organs degenerate: they become simply appendages to supply sperm when required.

Jack Dangers (born John Corrigan, 1965, in Swindon)  is an electronic musician, DJ, producer, and remixer best known for his work as the primary member of Meat Beat Manifesto.  He currently resides in San Francisco.

Career.
Prior to founding Meat Beat Manifesto together in 1987, both Jack Dangers and Jonny Stephens were members of a short-lived group called Perennial Divide. While Stephens remained a member for several years, Jack Dangers is the only person credited as a member of the band on every single Meat Beat Manifesto release.

In addition to his career with Meat Beat Manifesto, Jack Dangers has also contributed other projects.  Along with Mike Powell and Ben Stokes, he is a part of unusual breakbeat combo known simply as Tino.  Tino material is released through their independent label, Tino Corp.  Another collaboration called Loop Finder General was announced at one time, but the only recording that has surfaced under this name is a track on ¡Hello Friends!, a Jack Dangers DJ mix album primarily featuring Tino material.

As a remixer and producer, Dangers has collaborated with and reworked material for David Bowie, Nine Inch Nails, David Byrne, DJ Spooky, Depeche Mode, Coil and many others.

Dangers is an avid collector of obscure audio and video material, and frequently employs samples from his massive collection of records and videotapes in his music and during live shows.

Dangers also collects vintage electronic hardware; he owns an EMS Synthi 100 modular system that he claims is the only known working model. This unit is featured prominently on RUOK?, released in 2002. 

An activist for animal rights and a practicing vegan, Dangers has contributed (as part of Meat Beat Manifesto) to two benefit compilations for In Defense of Animals.  He credits his active concern for these issues to fellow musicians Consolidated, for whom he has produced several albums and done a number of remixes.

Dangers suffers from acute arthritis, which makes it difficult for him to play many conventional instruments; consequently, many of the "real" instrument sounds on his records are accomplished electronically.

<doc id="955001" title="Starcross (computer game)" nonfiltered="308" processed="306" dbindex="1480310">

Starcross is a 1982 interactive fiction game designed and implemented by Dave Lebling and published by Infocom. Like most Infocom titles, it was developed for many systems.  It was released for DOS, as a PC Booter, Apple II, Atari ST and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's fifth game.

The game was Infocom's first in the science fiction genre. It takes place in the year 2186, when the player's character is a lone black hole miner exploring an asteroid belt. The player's ship, the Starcross, is fitted with a mass detector to look for "quantum black holes", which are such powerful sources of energy that one could provide a wealth of riches. When the mass detector finally discovers an anomaly, however, it isn't a black hole but something else entirely: a massive craft of unknown origin and composition.

The player must dock with the mysterious ship and gain entry to its interior. Once inside, the player discovers a wide variety of alien plant and animal species and an array of unfamiliar technology.

Feelies.
Deadline, which was the previous release before Zork III, had included several items related to the game and proved wildly popular. Starcross continued the newly-established tradition of feelies with the following items:
Log of the M.C.S. Starcross, a whimsical journal of the player character's experiences on the ship;
A letter from the "Bureau of Extra-Solar Intelligence" providing advice for any encounters with alien lifeforms;
A partial space map of charted masses, including instructions on how to use the navigation computer;

Notes.
The original plans for this game's feelies incorporated "Astronaut Food", which was to be a small package of something edible and presumably freeze-dried. The idea presented legal problems involving health laws, however, and was dropped. The foil-wrapped package is still depicted in a picture of materials included with the game, appearing on the back of the game box.

The first box for Starcross was a round plastic box that resembled a flying saucer disc. This proved too costly to produce and too unwieldy for store shelves and was replaced by more conventional packaging such as the "grey box" format.

Starcross was rated by Infocom as "Expert" level in difficulty. This may be largely due to the scientific orientation of many of the game's puzzles. Other early Expert-level games were Deadline and Suspended.

The game's working title was A Gift from Space.

Taglines.
The challenge was issued eons ago from light years away. And only you can meet it.

<doc id="5015303" title="Lord's Resistance Army (1994-2002)" nonfiltered="310" processed="307" dbindex="1480312">

The start of the period 1994 to 2002 of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) insurgency in northern Uganda saw the conflict intensifying due to Sudanese support to the rebels.  There was a peak of bloodshed in the mid-1990s and then a gradual subsiding of the conflict. Violence was renewed beginning with the offensive by the Uganda People's Defence Force in 2002.

For an seven year period beginning in 1987, the Lord's Resistance Army was a minor rebel group along the periphery of Uganda.  However, two weeks after Museveni delivered his ultimatum of 6 February 1994, LRA fighters were reported to have crossed the northern border and established bases in southern Sudan with the approval of the Khartoum government.  The end of the Bigombe peace initiatives marks a fundamental shift in the character of the Lord's Resistance Army, which is estimated to have consisted of 3,000 to 4,000 combatants at this time.  This is the turning point at which the LRA becomes essentially the organization that operates today.

Sudanese support expands the scale of the conflict.
Sudanese aid was a response to Ugandan support for the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) fighting in the civil war in the south of the country.  Prior to this support, the LRA could be treated as a minor irritant in the outskirts of the country; now it also had to be considered a proxy force of the Khartoum government.  Sudanese support allowed the LRA to increase the intensity of its operations beyond the level at which it was previously capable.  Not only was a safe haven granted from which the LRA could launch attacks into Uganda, but Sudan also gave a large amount of arms, ammunition, land mines and other supplies.  In return, the LRA was expected to deny territory to the SPLA and periodically participate in joint operations with the Sudanese army.  The increased intensity of attacks through proxy forces led Uganda and Sudan to the brink of open hostilities in 1995.

Acholi civilians as targets.

There was also a marked change in how the LRA perceived the conflict.  Having become convinced that the Acholi were now collaborating with the Museveni government, Kony began to target the civilians using his increased military strength.  Mutilations such as those carried out in the wake of the Arrow Group strategy became commonplace, and 1994 saw the first mass forced abduction of children and young people. Other militant groups, such as the West Nile Bank Front, adopted the LRA tactics of abductions and raids. The strategy of forced recruitment was prompted by the lack of new volunteers to continue the conflict, and the fact that the young could be indoctrinated to support the LRA much more easily than adults.   Furthermore, the LRA no longer had to spend much of its energies in the search for basic supplies now that they were supported by Sudan.  The moral rationale was that since the Acholi adults had proven themselves untrustworthy, the LRA must cleanse the land of them and create a new society with the children.  This philosophical approach, similar to that taken by the Khmer Rouge of Cambodia, has been referred to as "auto-genocide."

The attacks on civilians have at least three strategic objectives.  First, to deny the government information about its movements by forcing the rural population to flee. Second, to gather resources from the looted villages. Third and most bizarrely, to show the populace that the government is unable or unwilling to provide protection, and thus encourage people to support to the LRA.  While the lack of security has certainly embittered many Acholi, this has not translated into support for the LRA forces that are attacking them.


There were numerous incidents that occurred after Sudanese support and are exceptional because of the large number of victims, the identity of the victims, or the circumstances of the incident.  On April 22, 1995, Atiak Trading Center in northern Gulu District was attacked and the Local Defense Forces routed. Over the course of the day between 170 and 220 civilians were killed in the absence of resistance from government forces.  On March 8, 1996, a civilian convoy of over 20 vehicles with a military escort of 14 soldiers travelling west on the Karuma-Pakwach road was ambushed. Between 50 and 110 civilians were killed, most after the escort had been overcome. Some were executed; others were killed after they refused to exit their buses and explosives were thrown inside.  The LRA carried out three separate attacks on July 13 to June 14 1996 upon a settlement of Sudanese refugees in southern Kitgum (now Pader District) administered by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Approximately 100 refugees were killed.  In the Lokung/Palabek massacre from January 7 to January 12, 1997, up to 412 civilians were killed in and around the subcounties of Lokung and Palabek in northwest Kitgum. There were no opposing forces and most victims were bludgeoned or hacked to death. 

The most famous attack of this period were the St. Mary's College/Aboke abductions on October 10, 1996.  At about 2 a.m. about 200 armed rebels broke into St. Mary's College in Aboke, northern Apac District, and abducted 139 secondary school girls between 13 and 16 years of age before leaving at about 5 a.m. At 7 a.m., the deputy head mistress of the college, Sister Rachele Fassera, pursued the rebels and negotiated the release of 109 of the girls. Five of the thirty remaining girls died in captivity; all but two eventually made their escape, as of 2006. 


Government forces have also been the focus of controversy.  On August 31, 1995, thirteen civilians, some with their hands tied behind their backs, were killed in a government gunship attack on an LRA column near Lokung, northwest Kitgum. Sixteen LRA combatants were also killed. Critics charged reckless disregard for abductee lives; the government claimed the killings were accidental and unintentional.  The military contributed to mob killings in Gulu Town on August 16, 1996.  Four LRA suspects were turned over to an Acholi mob that beat them to death. The suspects were under government custody and are reported to have been turned over to the mob in the presence of senior Uganda Fourth Division officers. 

The deaths of two Acholi elders on 8 June 1996 remains a mystery.  Mr. Okot Ogony of Cwero, eastern Gulu, Chairman of the Peace Commission of the Council of Acholi Chiefs, and Mr. Olanya Lacony, a respected elder from Kac-Goma, southwestern Gulu, were found murdered near Cwero in still unexplained circumstances. They were the leaders of a local initiative to restart the peace talks that had collapsed in February 1994 and had the approval of the President of Uganda and an invitation from the LRA. Some blame the LRA, while others point to corrupt National Resistance Army officers.

"Protected villages" created in 1996.

The creation of government "protected villages" beginning in 1996 further deepened the antagonistic attitude that many Acholi have toward the government.  While many Acholi were already displaced by the conflict, they resented being ordered into camps.  A strategy of resettlement, or "villagization," is a common anti-insurgent technique, used extensively for example by the United States throughout the Indian Wars to isolate Native Americans in reservations.   It is intended to free up troops that would otherwise be attempting to defend innumerable small communities and to deny the rebels access to resources.   Nevertheless, the population continues to be attacked by the LRA even within the "protected camps."  The camps are also crowded, unsanitary, and miserable places to live.

A culture of peace and a gradual subsiding.
The bloodshed in 1995 to 1996 appears to have convinced the population that a negotiated solution was the only acceptable option.  This is what one writer calls the emergence of "a culture of peace."  As most of the LRA combatants are abducted children, a military solution is widely seen by the Acholi as a massacre of victims.  Government attempts to destroy the rebels are thus viewed as another cause for grievance by the Acholi.  The moral ambiguity of this situation, in which abducted young rebels are both the victims and perpetrators of brutal acts, is vital in understanding the current conflict.   

Meanwhile, in 1997 the Sudanese government of the National Islamic Front had begun to back away from its previous hard-line stance.  This was prompted by the leadership of new President Omar al-Bashir, who wanted to ensure export of the oil from the newly developed fields being wrested from SPLA control. The U.S. had also taken a more proactive stance against the National Islamic Front government.  U.S. pressure on Sudan intensified following the 1998 bombing of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania by al-Qaeda operatives with links to Sudan.  Over the next several years, Khartoum is believed to have substantially curtailed aid to the LRA.  In 1999 the Carter Center mediated the Nairobi Agreement between Uganda and Sudan, which restored diplomatic relations in 2001.


In 2000, the Parliament of Uganda passed the Amnesty Act.  This act pardons rebels who give themselves up to the Amnesty Commission and renounce violence.  While it did not end the insurgency, it proved effective enough in some of the other regions of the country that had experienced rebellion to be maintained.

The sudden appearance of LRA units in June 2001 who contacted local government officials to discuss the possibility of dialogue created a flurry of speculation that the LRA was tiring of their insurgency.  The Uganda People's Defense Force   the renamed NRA   created a demilitarized zone for the talks, a measure that had the implicit approval of President Museveni.  The talks were exploratory in nature and the LRA units eventually returned to Sudan.  However, analysts believed that they were initiated at the behest of Kony and indicated the most promising diplomatic environment since the collapse of the Bigombe talks in 1994. 

Following the al-Qaeda attacks in 2001 upon the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in the U.S., the relationship between Sudan and Uganda abruptly changed.  The NIF government was anxious to avoid any blame that may be attached to them for their offering of sanctuary to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden for several years in the 1990s.  Also, following the LRA's designation as a terrorist organization by the U.S. State Department on 5 December 2001, Sudan agreed to stop supplying aid to the LRA.

Cross-border tensions were dialed down as support to proxy forces fell.  The LRA itself appeared settled into their Sudanese base camps and only periodically crossed the border.  Some of the hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced by the war began to return to their homes.  The number of people displaced by the conflict declined to about half a million, and people began to talk openly of the day when the "protected camps" would be disbanded.

"Eye for an Eye" is the forty-first episode in the TV-series Danny Phantom. A series of pranks between Danny and Vlad turns the older half ghost into running for mayor which he wins in a landslide by overshadowing voters. Now he plans to torment Danny's life with his newfound powers. 

Episode Summary.

Vlad's well polished manor is dismantled when the Guys in White breaks in, suspecting him of holding ghost contrabands, courtesy of Danny who watches the news of Vlad's broken down manor via computer later on, much to both Danny and Tucker's amusement and Sam's concern. Vlad however gets his revenge when the Guys in White enters Danny's room for the same reasons as Vlad until Sam tells them off, claiming they can't search without a warrant. 

Meanwhile Vlad is staying in a hotel in Amity Park, taking a shower while watching the news of himself and the upcoming mayoral elections. He gets a rude awakening when news helicopters surrounds him during his shower caused by transparency from Danny himself, exposing himself to the public to get back on the prank Vlad pulled earlier. Vlad in turn pulls the same prank by sending his vulture ghosts to turn the walls invisible for the entire student body in the cafeteria to see him while in the boy's locker room shower. He ups the ante by getting the Guys in White to destroy the Nasty Burger (Vlad claiming of more Ecto-bestos inside) to which he is now the current owner of, having bought it off. Danny angrily chats with Vlad long enough for him to get the idea to run for mayor after the destruction of the fast food joint to up the challenge between the two.

Danny catches this news from his father who is eager to vote for Vlad as mayor, so he desperately heads down to City Hall where Vlad had just given a speech. There, the two battle, Danny stating Vlad's gotten weaker until he realizes at the last minute that it was merely a decoy held long enough until multiple Vlad duplicates overshadow the voters to vote only for him (Vlad having stated his powers have long since increased), making him win in a landslide. With his powers, he orders school uniforms, no technologies, and even a new Nasty Burger under the name McMasters' (now designed to ban teenagers), and most importantly, Vlad makes claim to the public that Danny Phantom's presence will lure more ghosts into their towns. Adding insult to injury, surveillance cameras everywhere in the city watch Danny's every move should he try and transform, much to his frustration. In lack of any Danny Phantom, Vlad does a tremendous job cleaning up any ghosts that haunt Amity Park. 

Frustrated, Danny transform after Tucker takes out a surveillance camera near Nasty Burger and phases his way to Vlad's office to apologize for his behavior. However Vlad doesn't accept it, criticizes him, then sends the Guys in White to try and destroy him. Danny escapes then later recruits his fellow peers on Sam's idea to stage a protest for the return of Nasty Burger, one that catches Vlad's attention as he comes up to them in person. 

There, with cameramen nearby (as well as Danny's parents), Danny turns ghost, then comes back to rat out that Vlad Masters and Vlad Plasimus are one and the same. However Vlad Plasmius comes out of nowhere in the same area with Vlad Masters. There both he and Danny fight until Vlad Masters aims a Fenton gun (taken from Jack) at Plasmius. Danny sees Plasmius is merely a duplicate of him used to make Vlad Masters look good in the eyes of the people by killing his duplicate self. Danny however possesses the duplicate and flies him towards his limo where Vlad shoots, destroying both the duplicate and the limo. Underneath the wreckage, Danny (now human) stages his own plan by making Vlad look bad for hurting an innocent child. 

As a result, Vlad announces to the public later to repent by returning everything he did back to normal, including the Nasty Burger allowing teenagers back inside, ones which the children are happy for. Danny declares, however, that his battle with Vlad is far from over.

Allusion.
 Title: "Eye for an Eye" refers to the phrase "An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" from the book of Exodus 21:23-27. This principle is most famously used in the Code of Hammurabi.

McMasters, the restaurant Vlad erected in place of the Nasty Burger, is a play on McDonald's.

Vlad running for mayor alludes to Lex Luthor in the "President Luthor" Story Arc form Superman.

Tracy Lynn Byrd (born on December 17, 1966 in Beaumont, Texas) is a country music singer. 

Biography.
Byrd is the eldest child, and only son, of Jerry Lynn and Brenda Vaughn Byrd.  He and his sister Debra were raised in Vidor, Texas and were students in the Vidor, Texas public school system. 

Byrd never intended becoming a singer.  He began studying business at Texas State University (then called Southwest Texas State).  One of his friends coaxed him into singing a cover of Hank Williams Sr's "Your Cheating Heart" at a local mall recording studio.  The owner of the studio was so impressed with his version that he entered Byrd into a local talent contest.  Byrd discovered on that stage that he really liked the attention and applause that came with performing.

Byrd began playing nightclubs in Southeast Texas, including working with then-struggling artist Mark Chesnutt.  After Chesnutt secured a record deal, Byrd took over as the house band at Cutters Nightclub in Beaumont, landing his own record deal in 1992.  His first three albums sold over 3 million copies.

His first No. 1 single was 1993's "Holdin' Heaven," although many of his fans consider his follow-up hits "The Keeper of the Stars" (1995) and "I'm From the Country" (1998) the bigger hits. Byrd finally scored his second No. 1 hit in the fall of 2002, with "Ten Rounds With Jose Cuervo." He is also known for covering several 1970s-era hits for country music legend Johnny PayCheck, including "Someone to Give My Love To" (1993, Byrd's second chart hit) and "Don't Take Her She's All I Got" (1997).

Byrd is an avid outdoorsman.  He began fishing with his grandmother, Mavis Vaughn, when he was only three, and she bought him his first shotgun when he was six.   His love of those sports has given him the opportunity to host two shows on the Outdoor Channel.  

Byrd is the National Spokesperson for Special Olympics International for the Country Music Association.  He developed a crank bait fishing lure marketed by Norman Lures called The Lifestyles Of The Not So Rich & Famous, named after his hit recording of the song written by Byron Hill and Wayne Tester. For every one of the lures sold Byrd donates ten cents to the Special Olympics.

Byrd also hosts an annual golfing/fishing/music event, "The Tracy Byrd Homecoming Weekend," in Southeast Texas to raise money for local charities, including the March of Dimes, the Children's Miracle Network, and culminating in the donation of money to fund the Tracy Byrd Hyperbaric Medicine and Wound Care Center at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Beaumont.  Byrd also raised money by soliciting pledges for his attemp to complete the 2001 Houston Marathon.  He finished the marathon, and donated all of his pledges to the Children's Miracle Network.

In 1994, he made a cameo appearance in the film Radioland Murders.  He has also published Eat Like a Byrd: The Tracy Byrd Cookbook which "uses rubs and marinades to create memorable meals.".  He has also launched a line of spices, rubs, and marinades to go along with it, called "Tracy Byrd's Tiny Town Products."  These are available at Wal-Mart and Kroger stores, Byrd donates five cents from each sale to the Children's Miracle Network.

Byrd and his wife, Michelle, have two sons and daughter.  The family lives in Beaumont, Texas.

<doc id="45855" title="Power supply (Star Trek)" nonfiltered="317" processed="314" dbindex="1480319">
In the fictional Star Trek universe, starships have a power core that takes up most of the height from the roof to the floor of the engineering section of the vessel. In the 24th century all Starfleet vessels use matter/antimatter power cores. These use matter, heavy hydrogen slush/metal, and antimatter, antiprotons, and antineutrons.
The result is that the protons and the antiprotons cancel each other out in a small explosive blast as do the neutrons and the antineutrons. The remainder is the electrons and the raw energy created by the reaction. This is all focused by dilithium crystals into electrons and takes the form of a dense cloud of electroplasma (EP) and is transferred through the EPS conduits (Electro-Plasma System). The electroplasmic conduit system supplies power to the entire vessel. Electroplasmic conduits have several secondary bypass conduits in case the primary conduits are ruptured. They also have emergency routes that can redirect required energy to battle stations and systems during Red Alert. These emergency bypasses can increase the direct supply of EPS from the power core to the phasers and shield generators. Another name for a power matter/antimatter core is the "warp core", as it is used to create a subspace bubble around the vessel in order to enter subspace, thus allowing a vessel to reach warp superluminal velocities.

Michael Penn (born August 1, 1958, in Greenwich Village, New York City) is an American singer and songwriter. He is the son of actor/director Leo Penn and actress Eileen Ryan, and the brother of actors Sean Penn and Chris Penn.

Prior to the release of his 1989 debut album March, Penn performed the song "This & That" with his band The Pull on a 1987 episode of Saturday Night Live. Before that, he was a member of the Los Angeles band Doll Congress and had appeared as an extra on a few television series, including St. Elsewhere.

March, particularly the first single, "No Myth," brought Penn attention, as well as the 1990 MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist. Penn's follow-up albums Free-for-All (1992), Resigned (1997) and MP4: Days Since a Lost Time Accident (2000) weren't able to match the success of March, although critics praised his songcraft.

Penn met fellow singer-songwriter Aimee Mann in the late 1980s, and during the recording of her album I'm With Stupid (to which Penn contributed vocals), the two struck up a friendship, which blossomed into romance and their 1997 marriage. Together with manager Michael Hausman they formed United Musicians, which is based on the idea of allowing artists to keep copyright ownership of their works and to assist with their promotion and distribution. Penn and Mann live in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles.  They have no children, but Penn has a son from a previous marriage.

Penn moved into film scoring after repeated requests from director Paul Thomas Anderson, who had apparently listened to Free-for-All extensively while writing his first feature, Hard Eight, and wanted Penn to score the film. Penn also scored Anderson's follow-up Boogie Nights, in which he appears briefly as a recording engineer. During the editing process of the film, Anderson directed a music video with Penn for the song "Try" from Resigned (the music video can be found on the Boogie Nights DVD). Other films scored by Penn include Alan Cumming's first two directorial efforts, The Anniversary Party and Suffering Man's Charity ; Melvin Goes to Dinner; the documentary The Comedians of Comedy; and The Last Kiss.

Penn's fifth album, Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947, was released August 2, 2005, on Mimeograph Records (Penn's own label) and SpinART Records. Penn has said that the album, which may be the first of two parts, is set after World War II and involves "the trauma that a war brings to a person's psychology." 

A best-of compilation, Palms and Runes, Tarot and Tea: A Michael Penn Collection, is scheduled for release on April 17, 2007, as is a reissue of Mr. Hollywood Jr., 1947 with bonus tracks.

CARINE is a first-order classical logic automated theorem prover. 

CARINE is a resolution based theorem prover initially built for the study of the enhancement effects of the strategies delayed clause-construction (DCC) and attribute sequences (ATS) in a depth-first search based algorithm. CARINE's main search algorithm is semi-linear resolution (SLR) which is based on an iteratively-deepening depth-first search (also known as depth-first iterative-deepening (DFID) 1985). SLR employs DCC to achieve a high inference rate, and ATS to reduce the search space.

The Book of Fours is an original novel based on the American television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

Plot summary.

Taking place during Buffy's third season, Faith and Buffy are the current Slayers and when mayhem caused by tidal waves and burning forests begin to erupt in Sunnydale as well as vicious attackers appearing with ceremonial axes, the gang knows that something is up. A woman named Cecile Lafitte has sent her Servants to kill the Slayers with special axes, Faith being the Slayer of Fire and Buffy being the Slayer of Air. Each Slayer has a special axe made to destroy the Slayer of that particular element. There are four axes in total; air, fire, water and earth. Should Faith and Buffy both be killed then it's believed that the line of Slayers would die out forever. Cecile wants to bring forth the Gatherer, and the only way to do so is to have the Slayers killed, which would feed the demon enough power to bring him forth into the world. Meanwhile, Willow ends up in the hospital with major brain trauma while Giles figures they need answers from the Watcher of the Slayer that preceded Buffy, India Cohen.

Trivia.

Tagline: 'To combat a quartet of unnatural disasters, four slayers must band together: Buffy, Kendra, Faith and India'.
India Cohen was the slayer that preceded Buffy. She is seen on the front cover of the book, the third from left. The character also appears in Tales of the Slayer, Volume III, in the story The Code of the Samurai.
On one page where Willow is talking about her dream with Matthew Broderick, Buffy says 'You pick the strangest guys to dream about, Will' . . . 'How come it's never someone current? Y'know like Seth Green?' Seth Green plays Oz, Willows boyfriend in Buffy.

Characters.

Buffyverse canon characters include: Buffy, Angel, Giles, Willow, Xander, Faith, Cordelia, Oz, Joyce, Kendra, Roger (Sam) Zabuto, Principal Snyder, Willy the Snitch, Sheila Rosenberg ;
Buffyverse non-canon characters include: India Cohen (Slayer); Kit Bothwell (India's Watcher); Lucy Hanover (ghostly Slayer); Simon LaFitte (voodoo king); Cecile LaFitte (voodoo practitioner); Mirielle (insane girlfriend of Zabuto); Anthony Yorke (traitorous Watcher); Micaela Tomassi (sorcerer); Cameron Duvalier (evil servant); Tervokian (demon); Cordelia's Mother; Willow's Father; Xander's Aunt & Uncle; Kevin Harris (Xander's cousin); Carlos New Mexico (crazy homeless man); Mark Corvalis (firefighter); Monica Hamilton (nurse); Holly Johnson (rescued girl); Amanda & Ben Johnson (Holly's parents); Neema Mfune-Hayes (Watcher); Ibn Rashad; Taran; The Gatherer (ancient demon); The Wanderers (Gatherer's four servants).

Continuity.

Supposed to be set late in Buffy Season 3, after Xander and Cordelia have broken up. Fits into an alternative continuity in which the events of the Gatekeeper trilogy took place a year before the events of this book.
Shares continuity with many Buffy books including the Gatekeeper trilogy, Immortal, and Spike and Dru: Pretty Maids All in a Row.

Canonical issues.
;

Buffy comics such as this one are not usually considered by fans as canonical. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike fan fiction, overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and Joss Whedon (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy merchandise. ;

Timing.

<doc id="7422517" title="Hearing Secret Harmonies" nonfiltered="326" processed="323" dbindex="1480328">
Hearing Secret Harmonies is the final novel in Anthony Powell's twelve-volume masterpiece, A Dance to the Music of Time. It was published in 1975 to the relief of an audience that had grown steadily over the twenty-four years since the first book, A Question of Upbringing appeared in 1951.

Completing his meditation upon the themes of time and will, the author recounts the narrative in the voice of a convincingly middle-aged Jenkins. (Interestingly in the television adaptation of the novels an older actor was chosen to play Nick in the final part.) 

Whilst evading the trap of tying up every plot line Powell nonetheless satisfies the reader's pent-up desire to know the fate of the principal surviving characters. 

Though well received critically, Hearing Secret Harmonies has sometimes been held by academics to be the weakest of the twelve novels in the cycle. However Powell scholars like Hilary Spurling and his biographers, Michael Barber and Nicholas Birns broadly disagree.

A lyrical quality in the writing, not present in earlier volumes, has been detected, although the development of the character of the cult leader Scorpio Murtlock lends some astringency to the narrative. The sketch of university life in the late 'sixties offers a dryly satirical interlude before Widmerpool loses his final power struggle and expires in bathetic circumstances.

Plot summary.

In Spring, almost another decade on, the Jenkinses act as host to a caravan of hippies led by Scorpio Murtlock, allowing them to camp on their land. One of the band is Fiona Cutts (daughter of Roddy Cutts, thus a niece of Isobel's). Murtlock is keenly interested in the nearby Devil's Fingers standing stones.

Widmerpool is appointed Chancellor of a new university, and is promptly daubed with paint by the Quiggin twins (Amanda and Belinda, daughters of JG Quiggin and Ada Leintwardine); Widmerpool is thereby converted to the current counter-culture. Nick visits Matilda Donners, and is shown the photographs of the Seven Deadly Sins tableaux of 30 years before.

The Donners Memorial Prize is established. A year or so later Nick is a member of the committee who award the annual prize to Russell Gwinnett for his biography of X Trapnel. Widmerpool brings the Quiggin twins to the presentation dinner where he makes an impromptu speech, and the twins disrupt proceedings with a stink bomb.

At a Royal Academy dinner Nick gets an account of Dr Trelawney and of Murtlock's boyhood from Canon Fenneau. Widmerpool asks the Canon to put him in touch with Murtlock.

By Spring 1970 there are hints of Widmerpool and Murtlock joining forces. At midsummer conservationists muster at the Devil's Fingers and there are reports of naked dancers there the previous evening. Gwinnett describes Murtlock's attack on Widmerpool during a pagan sex ritual at the Devil's Fingers that night.

Spring 1971 sees a family wedding reception at Stourwater. Fiona Cutts, released from Murtlock's grip, appears newly married to Gwinnett. Widmerpool, leading a run by Murtlock's cult, arrives at the reception and pays embarrassing public penance to the bride's grandfather for a misdemeanour at school. Murtlock appears and ruthlessly extracts Widmerpool and cult members from the proceedings.

The final chapter sees Jenkins in Autumn 1971 lighting a bonfire and reflecting on a recent revival in Bosworth Deacon's pictures. He has recently attended the art gallery which is selling the Deacon paintings and where he met a now invalid Bob Duport, Polly and Signora Flores (Jean). While there he gets an inside account from Henderson (formerly one of Murtlock's followers) of life in the cult. Bithel (also part of the cult) arrives with news of Widmerpool's death on a naked run with Murtlock's followers.

<doc id="573460" title="Space Ghost Coast to Coast" nonfiltered="327" processed="324" dbindex="1480329">



Space Ghost Coast to Coast (often abbreviated as SGC2C) is an animated spoof talk show on the cable TV channel Cartoon Network in the United States, Bravo in the UK, and Teletoon in Canada. It began in 1994. The main cast comprises Space Ghost (born Tad Ghostal), a cartoon character originally from an old Hanna Barbera cartoon called Space Ghost which ran in the 1960s and early 1980s, and Zorak and Moltar, his former enemies from that show. Space Ghost is voiced by George Lowe, while C. Martin Croker voices Zorak and Moltar. Other characters include Brak, Lokar, Metallus, Black Widow, and Tansut, all of whom also made appearances in the original Hanna-Barbera series. The fictional talk show is shot and broadcast from Space Ghost's studio on the Ghost Planet. Space Ghost also has a twin brother Chad, who is somewhat smarter but has an apparent evil streak. Luckily, he can be identified by his ever changing facial hair, macho voice, and his use of hipster slang. 



Various celebrities appear on the show as guests. They are shown on a TV screen next to Space Ghost, and unlike the characters, they are not animated.

Space Ghost Coast to Coast uses the talk show format as its template, but subverts it regularly. Space Ghost himself is portrayed as pompous, ignorant, and slightly deranged. He apparently believes his guests are other superheroes and usually opens the interview by asking them about their superpowers. His interactions with guests are almost always painfully awkward, and sometimes hostile. It is sometimes hard to tell if all of the guests are really aware of the nature of the program on which they are appearing. Their answers often do not match the "questions" coming from Space Ghost, because the questions are changed after the interview. 

His relationship with his co-workers is worse. His bandleader, an evil talking mantis named Zorak, and his producer, a red-helmeted lava man named Moltar, work for Space Ghost as punishment for their crimes, and make no secret of the fact that they hate him.

Space Ghost is shown to be arrogant, showboatish, uninformed, oblivious to his own stupidity, and violent when provoked. His powers include invisibility (courtesy of his Inviso-Belt, although it's really just an outline of SG), flight, and the ability to shoot powerful beams from the Power Bands on his wrists. 

Zorak attempts to be "pure evil" ,even if neutered by his imprisonment, and spends his time on the show making fun of Space Ghost, generally getting blasted in return for his efforts by Space Ghost's power bands. At other times however, his resistance to Space Ghost is more oblique, preferring to just ignore Space Ghost's quixotic tendencies in a quiet method of rebellion.

Moltar is more placid about his predicament and enjoys watching CHiPs reruns on the monitors during the show, as well as talking to the guests before their interviews, but he will often chide Space Ghost along with Zorak and become his sidekick in tormenting Space Ghost.

Unlike most modern cable series, each episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast is only 15 minutes in length. To remedy this, Cartoon Network stuck two episodes back to back in order to make a 30 minute programming block, something Adult Swim (comprised mostly of the creators of SGC2C) has duplicated in much of its original programming. In 1995 Cartoon Network created a spin-off show called Cartoon Planet. This featured Space Ghost and friends attempting to host a variety show on the Cartoon Planet. Cartoon Network placed this show right after Coast to Coast in order to attract ratings. The Brak Show, a situation comedy starring Brak's hijinks as an adolescent, was also spun off as an independent 15 minute program.

Show production.
Part of the surreal nature of the show comes from the guests' sometimes awkward and disjointed responses to Space Ghost's questions and other events around the set. This is the intentional result of the production process that was first laid out in the original (unaired) pilot episode. This episode was created by Mike Lazzo, who interspersed stock and original material with completely unrelated promotional video of Denzel Washington being interviewed about the Oscars. When the show was picked up, similar interviews were orchestrated with guests to achieve the same comedic effect.

Before any part of the episodes are written, the guests are interviewed by a writer/producer.  Originally, a Space Ghost costume was worn by Andy Merrill, one which he later made famous in some Cartoon Planet intros.  More often the writer/producer appears in normal dress, but may still impersonate Space Ghost's character traits and mannerisms. In many cases, the interviewee is alone in a studio, while the interviewer conducts the session over a speaker phone.  In the all black room where the interview takes place, the guests are told what basic directions to look in to "talk" to Zorak, Moltar, or Space Ghost. The interviewer also rarely reveals his actual name so that the guest is forced to address him as "Space Ghost".  This serves to both maintain continuity and to engender a sense of bewilderment in the guest. 

Guests are asked questions which often reveal a hidden New World agenda. After an interview is done, the writing team goes back over it, taking pieces out of context and out of order, then assembling them into the "responses" to Space Ghost and the rest of the show. The episode is written around these canned reactions and the writing talent of producers Williams Street (known as "Ghost Planet Industries," named after the fictional studio where SGC2C is supposedly taped, for most of the show's run).

Most of the show's earlier guests probably assumed they were participating in a relatively straightforward interview (albeit with an animated superhero, giant insect, and a man made of liquid magma). As the series went on, however, more and more guests became at least peripherally familiar with what was going on. Some episodes were written to accommodate playfully hostile guests who called the show's bluff, such as comedian (and writer of one SGC2C episode) Joel Hodgson's refusal to, as he put it, "Go down that road with you, pretending we're in space and all". Others had skits written for the guests to perform in outside of the normal interviews. Still others had recurring guests, familiar with the show's format. Reportedly, "Weird Al" Yankovic walked into his Coast to Coast interview with answers he prepared ahead of time, but opted not to use them.

Theme Song.
The theme song for Space Ghost Coast to Coast, also known as the "Ghost Planet National Anthem" was performed by avant-jazz guitarist Sonny Sharrock and his drummer, Lance Carter. The theme song was extended in the episode "Sharrock", as the episode itself is a tribute to Sonny Sharrock.  When the show reached its sixth season, the theme song was abandoned. It was shown a few times in Season 8, however, including a slow version for the episode In Memory of Elizabeth Reed. Seasons 4-6 featured a new closing theme by Man or Astro-man?.

Broadcast history.
In the United States, Space Ghost Coast to Coast premiered on April 15, 1994 on the Cartoon Network airing initially at 11:00pm on Friday nights, seven years before the advent of Adult Swim. Later the program was moved to various late-night time slots, usually on weekends. These late-night airings and the development of similar shows by Williams Street Studios led to the creation of the Adult Swim program block. Space Ghost Coast to Coast re-runs now air on Adult Swim's online-exclusive Adult Swim Fix service.

The show was initially broadcast on Cartoon Network UK during an early evening slot (around 6pm on Sunday nights), before eventually being moved to a late-night slot (around 10:30pm). During late 2001 and early 2002 four episodes aired every night at 11.00pm, though only ones from the first four years of the show's life. It later aired on CNX in its hour of comedy from 9pm 10pm alongside other programmes from the Adult Swim programming block. In Australia, it currently screens on Friday and Saturday nights in the local Adult Swim segment.

Space Ghost Coast To Coast was supposed to premiere on Teletoon in Canada in 1998, but never did. It was said that a celebrity somehow stopped that decision. 
However, it is now airing as announced, started September 2006.

New, short episodes currently play in rotation on Turner Broadcasting's GameTap online service (paid monthly registration required) in which Space Ghost interviews celebrities from the video game industry.

The episodes "Gum, Disease", "The Mask", "Le Livre D'Histoire", "Brilliant #2", and "A Space Ghost Christmas" were shown sporadically and then not released for DVD (due to video rights issues).

Though the show is on a "permanent hiatus" it has made two different returns. Once, after airing Perfect Hair Forever's pilot episode, Space Ghost was shown conducting a special talkback episode of the show with Early Cuyler, Sharko, and Meatwad about Perfect Hair Forever. The entire thing degenerated into typical Space Ghost/Adult Swim randomness, including Space Ghost himself being killed by Early Cuyler. After this, Space Ghost was only seen in cameos on Perfect Hair Forever where it was explained that after the end of his show he became a drunk that wandered around the Williams Street studios begging for a job. However, Space Ghost's show made another return on Turner's broadband entertainment network, GameTap. At E3, Space Ghost randomly showed up to conduct a series of live interviews including one with Microsoft executive Peter Moore. Space Ghost discussed bathroom etiquette, his own video game idea (A "dermatology based" video game), Sony, Turner, and dancing with Moore.

Beyond the original run of the series, at least two additional episodes were announced and had their respective interviews filmed, but were never finished.  These included interviews with Seth Green and Family Guy creator Seth Macfarlane.  While neither of these interviews were aired in any episode of the show, an Easter Egg on the Volume 3 set features "Commander Andy" (Andy Merrill) talking to Macfarlane. Space Ghost has also been featured in a commercial for e-surance, interviewing the company's spokes cartoon Erin. Space Ghost spent most of the interview fantasing about sleeping with her.

Characters.
Space Ghost (voiced by George Lowe): Tad Ghostal was once a superhero and famous television star, but fell into obscurity after his show was cancelled. He sees his current employment as host of a relatively mediocre late night talk show as pale compared to his "glory days". He is remarkably egotistical despite his overwhelming idiocy and remains generally oblivious to his surroundings. He has little regard for the well-being of others and often demeans his sidekicks and guests.


Zorak (voiced by C. Martin Croker): The band leader and a mantis-like alien, Zorak is known for his hatred of Space Ghost. Extremely evil, he once ate his own nephew. He is a virgin, by virtue of not wanting to be killed by his mate, as is the custom. He has no remorse, feels no pity, and acts only to meet his own ends. He was Brak's childhood friend.

Moltar (voiced by C. Martin Croker): is the show's director/producer. His body is made entirely of lava, and he normally wears a full-body containment suit. By far the most competent and level headed character, he has attempted (sometimes successfully) to escape Ghost Planet on several occasions. He has been happily married for about five years to a woman named Linda, and his father was a professional wrestler.

"Swingin" Chad Ghostal (voiced by Brad Abelle): Space Ghost's evil twin brother distinguished from Space Ghost in physical appearance only by a crudely drawn goatee. He is a hipster, and is both extremely cool and evil. So much so in fact, that he makes Moltar and Zorak "look like total chumps". Chad loves Jazz music, hipster talk, and outdated slang. He is also quite the ladies' man. He is currently a fugitive, wanted for murder and escaping the asylum he was held in. He may be a rendition of the Space Spectre, Space Ghost's opposite number during his time as a superhero.

Tansut (voiced by Don Kennedy) is an overweight and cowardly man in a red costume and helmet. This outfit makes him out to be much more cruel than he actually acts. He is easily scared and is often ridiculed for his cowardice. For a while, he was the announcer on the show, telling the viewers who the guests would be for the episode, and has subbed for Moltar as director at least once.

Brak (voiced by Andy Merrill): Loud, childish, and physically harmless, Brak is the least threatening villain on the program. Yet his capacity to annoy others and eat beans is nothing less than potent. His most uttered phrase was, for a time, a loud, grating, "Hi, my name is Brak!". He is thought, by some, to have some mental deficiency (on the spinoff show Cartoon Planet, he claimed that "radiation half-lobotomized me!", possibly a reference to the original Space Ghost cartoon). He appeared on SGC2C periodically, and was often victimized by Space Ghost or the show's villains.  He eventually, somehow, obtained his own spinoff, The Brak Show.

Lokar (voiced by Andy Merrill):  Cultured and erudite, despite being a shrill-voiced giant hominid locust prone to violent outbursts. Lokar still harbors a bit of a grudge, and seeks Space Ghost's destruction, perhaps more for his boorishness than anything else. He is frequently accused of being effeminate by other cast members. He has a penchant for bourgeois phrases like "you go girl". He claims his hatred for Space Ghost is "delicious." He is also in a long-running feud with Zorak.

The Original Way Outs are the show's band, made up of former villains. They are apparently Space Ghost's prisoners, just like Zorak and Moltar, but are much less talkative. Usually, when they are cued to play music and the whole band is in view, music is definitely played, but not by them.  While the music is "playing," usually the only thing literally moving in the band is one cymbal on the drum set.

Harvey Birdman originally auditioned to be the host of the show according to Episode 40, "Pilot." He's similar to Space Ghost in that he is a washed up superhero, incompetent and slow, and horrible with people, not to mention that he can't work nights due to needing the Sun's energy to stay awake. Space Ghost once called him a washed up Six-piece Chicken McNobody. He reprises his role as host on Episode 74, "Sequel," during Space Ghost's brief imprisonment for abusing Zorak. He also appeared on the side lines during Episode 35, "Rehearsal", and making a call on Episode 55, "Telethon". He appears to be washed up, and in a rut, alternately claiming to be unemployed, or in one case selling towable campers. He used to be married to Gravity Girl, whom he constantly pleads to "come home". The character in SGC2C has little to do with the show Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law beyond giving the first name of "Harvey" to the character.

Metallus, a villain who can only talk in a metallic drone.

Black Widow (voiced by Judy Tenuta), a villain who has professed love for Space Ghost, much to the chagrin of the other villains.

Kirk the Storyteller (played by James Kirkconnell), the venerable narrator/storyteller, presenting several episodes in retrospect and reinterpretation.  The episode Curses was shown to have taken place in one of his nightmares.

Trivia.
 According to TV Guide articles written when the show was in pre-production, former Fantasy Island star Hervé Villechaize was to be Space Ghost's sidekick on the show. However, Villechaize committed suicide before production began.
 Some episodes suggest personal relationships with the guest. The most odd one was the interview with Al Alcorn in one of the GameTap episodes. Al, here known as "Mr. Pong" was, as Space Ghost claimed, "shacking up with a mantis (Zorak)" when he revealed himself to be Zorak's father. It is obviously untrue, even though Alcorn "has beady, cold-blooded eyes, and emanates evil".

 Cartoon Planet: Space Ghost, Zorak, and Brak try to host a show on Cartoon Planet.
 The Brak Show: Stars Brak and Zorak from Space Ghost.  Space Ghost himself also made several appearances.
 Aqua Teen Hunger Force: Episode 87, "Baffler Meal," reveals that ATHF was conceptualized on Space Ghost C2C before it was turned into a series, although the actual episode aired after ATHF became its own series. The episode, as revealed in the commentary track on the ATHF Vol. 2 DVD was also produced after ATHF first showed on Adult Swim.
 12 oz. Mouse: Though not a direct spin-off, the Shark character is from Episode 79, "Kentucky Nightmare," where his original name was "Old Kentucky Shark.";
 Perfect Hair Forever: Again, not a direct spin-off, but Space Ghost and references to Space Ghost appear every episode.
 Toonami: Once again, not a direct spin-off, but Moltar was host of this block in its early days. Perhaps this is why he did not appear in Cartoon Planet.

"FoodLand" is the name of at least two American supermarket chains. 

Foodland Hawaii.

Foodland Super Market, Ltd. operates 29 stores throughout the state of Hawaii under the "Foodland" and "Sack 'N Save" names. It is headquartered in Honolulu, Hawaii. "Food, Family & Friends" is their current slogan. The chain traces its roots back to 1948 when it opened its first store in Honolulu's Market City. By 1967 it would expand statewide. Today they are the only locally-owned supermarket chain in Hawaii.

FoodLand Eastern America.

The Eastern U.S. Foodland  operates 91 stores, including 37 throughout West Virginia, 2 in southwestern Virginia, 34 in the Pittsburgh area of western Pennsylvania, 8 in eastern Kentucky, 7 in southeastern Ohio, 3 in the panhandle of western Maryland, and 2 in the state of Michigan. Their slogan is "Close to Home." Every FoodLand location is locally owned and operated, with inventory support from SuperValu. To compete with other grocery chains such as Giant Eagle and Shop 'n Save, FoodLand is now operating gas stations/convience stores in the greater Pittsburgh area known as FueLand. All FueLand locations are located just outside the grocery store. An undetermined number of stores located  particularly in Alabama, share the same logo as the West Virginia-based chain but appear to be otherwise separate.

The name "Foodland," being fairly generic in nature and apparently not a registered trademark, appears as all or part of the name of countless unaffiliated grocery stores throughout the country, as well as in Australia, Canada and Thailand

A penny arcade can be any type of venue for coin-operated devices, usually for entertainment.  This included early forms of pinball and fortune telling machinery of the 1930s. Vending machines may also be considered in this category. The name derives from the penny, once a staple coin for such machines.

The earliest penny arcades from the nineteenth century had machines called bagatelles a game combining pinball and billiards.  Later, penny arcade machines grew closer to modern pinball.

Another form of machine found in penny arcades were peep show machines (ancient usage of the term) which allowed the viewer to see various views of objects and later moving pictures. Slot machines, love testers, fortune teller machines and other coin operated devices were found in such venues.

Penny arcades later led to the creation of video arcades in the 1970s.

"Adrift" is the 26th episode of Lost. It is the second episode of the show's second season. The episode was directed by Stephen Williams, and written by Steven Maeda and Leonard Dick. It first aired on September 28, 2005 on ABC. The character of Michael Dawson is featured in the episode's flashback.



Plot. 

Sawyer surfaces in the ocean after the attack on the raft. The raft is burning, with pieces of wreckage floating everywhere. Michael is heard screaming for Walt repeatedly, and Sawyer screaming for Jin. Sawyer decides to rescue Michael first, and swims over to him, dragging him onto a piece of flotsam and performing CPR. 

On their makeshift raft, Michael blames Sawyer for making him fire the flare, drawing their attackers to them. Shortly after, something pounds on the raft from below. When Sawyer and Michael investigate, they see the distinctive fin of a shark. Michael blames Sawyer's bleeding wound for attracting the shark, and this devolves into an argument which ends when Michael orders Sawyer off his piece of raft. Sawyer complies, moving onto another piece of the raft, but soon the two are arguing again. Sawyer's piece of raft disintegrates, forcing him to rejoin Michael.

As they continue to float along with the current, one of the raft's pontoons appears, and they decide to board it. Sawyer swims to the pontoon, giving Michael his gun in case the shark appears. When it does, Michael fires several times, apparently injuring the shark, which breaks off.  Michael numbly swims for the pontoon, where Sawyer waits for him.

During Michael's flashbacks, he remembers his early custody struggles with Susan, who has asked Michael to sign away his paternal rights to Walt. Though Michael initially resists, suing to keep his rights, he eventually relents as Susan persuades him to doubt his own motivations and whether he is pursuing his own desires or Walt's best interests. As part of the flashback there is a parting scene between Michael and Walt. Michael gives Walt a toy polar bear.

When day breaks on the raft, Michael is crying. He realizes that he should not have brought Walt with him on the raft, even if all he really wanted was to be with his son. Michael tells Sawyer that Walt's kidnapping was his own fault. At this point, Sawyer notices that they are back at the island. When they wash ashore, they are greeted by Jin running toward them, hands tied behind his back, shouting the word "Others", and fleeing a group holding him captive.

Back at camp, Claire discovers Charlie carrying the Virgin Mary statue stolen from the Beechcraft 18, but does not know about the heroin contained inside.

After Kate disappears into the hatch, Locke descends as well, finding an unconscious Kate in the computer room. An armed Desmond walks up behind them, and asks Locke if he is "him". Locke at first claims to be the person whom Desmond is seeking, but fails to correctly answer the riddle that Desmond poses to him.  This failure prompts Desmond to round up the two. Desmond orders Kate to tie Locke up, but Locke convinces Desmond she should be tied up. When Desmond concurs, Locke slides her one of his knives, and locks her in a dark room. Kate frees herself, and turns on a light, amazed to find herself in a large pantry filled with foodstuffs, all in boxes bearing a strange marking. After enjoying a chocolate bar, she climbs into a ventilation shaft, while Locke and Desmond take turns asking each other questions.

The plotline converges to the same point at the end of the last episode, Man of Science, Man of Faith. An alarm klaxon begins to sound. Desmond walks Locke at gunpoint to the computer terminal, and forces him to enter "the numbers" into the computer, which resets a timer for the alarm. Soon after, Desmond detects Jack, and after channeling him to the computer room, forces Locke to greet Jack as seen in the previous episode (though this time, we see Kate's perspective too, overhead in the ventilation shaft).

Trivia.

When Sawyer is getting ready to swim to the other platform, a shark swims past, and in an underwater shot the DHARMA Initiative insignia can briefly be seen near its back fin. However, according to the bonus material disc on the Season Two DVD, this was not meant to be significant, but was simply an inside joke or "easter egg", which turned out to be more visible than had been intended.

Mudflap (Demolishor in Japan) is the name of a single character in the Transformers universes.

 (2005).

Mudflap transforms into a construction crane. In the Japanese version of the series; Transformers: Galaxy Force, the character is called Demolishor.

In the cartoon, Mudflap was originally one of the Autobot civilian refugees hiding on Earth. Disgruntled with having to exist in secret amongst the lowly  human race and stopping at traffic lights, Mudflap was sought out and recruited to join the Decepticons by Starscream, but then he left and wandered Earth. Eventually Mudflap rejoins the Autobots. 

His toyline bio, however, tells a different story. In this version of events, Mudflap was an undercover Decepticon operative placed on Earth before the Autobots had even arrived. Having infiltrated the construction industry, he spent his time sabotaging the infrastructure of human society.

According to the additional information accessible online by entering the code printed on the back of toy's Cyber Planet Key at the official Transformers website, Mudflap is a former boxer.

The toy of Mudflap was sold in the larger "Voyager" size class. The toy was initially sold by itself, and later sold at Target stores with the Mini-Cons Shockwave and Tankor attached as a promotion.

Animated series.
Main Episode Appearances:
Ep.15-Race: Mudflap joins the Decepticons
Ep.20-Ice: Starscream and Mudflap attack the humans at the North Pole and Mudflap beats Scattorshot to a pulp.
Ep.23-Trust: Mudflap battles Snarl and Leobreaker on the Jungle Planet, but loses.
Ep.27-Revalations: Landmine discovers that Mudflap is evil. Mudflap says that he doesn't want to hurt Landmine, but he's "gotta' do what he's gotta do!" So they duke it out.
Ep.33-Balance: When Megatron, Scourge, and Thunderblast head into the debris field surrounding Cybertron, Mudflap, thinking Megatron has betrayed him, heads back to Earth.
Ep.37-Family: As Mudflap is beating up some trees, he wonders to himself why he had joined the Decepticons. Landmine shows up and Mudflap becomes an Autobot again. 

When the Autobots attempted to use a gigantic rocket to move the Jungle Planet back into it's orbit, Galvatron attacked and damaged the rocket. The Jungle Planet threatened to crash into Cybertron. The combined strength of Scourge, the Autobots, the former Decepticons (Dark Crumplezone, Ransack, Thunderblast and Thundercracker), and their allies from the various planets (including Mudflap) were able to combine their strength and move the rocket back into place.

Mudflap's voice in the Cybertron cartoon is performed with some variation of a French accent - viewers have disagreed over whether it is intended to sound Cajun, French Canadian, or just generically French.

Trivia.
When the character of Signal Lancer was animated in the final episode of Cybertron, the animators used a slightly modified transformation sequence from Mudflap. 

Early concept art of Mudflap shown at Botcon 2006 showed concept art of the character done in dark blue with white and gold highlights.

RS250-Squid is the online username of Andy Briggs, a young English motorcyclist from Sheffield, South Yorkshire.

 Early years .


Born in 1985, Squid attended local queen schools before going on to study at Thomas Rotherham College in Rotherham. He stayed here for a short time, studying various nondescript pointless subjects, and maintaining an active interest in young boys, music and automotive technology. While his interest in these subjects was seen as commendable, it did not help him with the college subjects he had chosen to study, and he soon left college after reaching mutual consent due to unsatisfactory punctuality and attendance.

Shortly after leaving a second college, Andy went into his first term of paid employment, working for Alchemy Pewter, part of the Alchemy Gothic group. Here he studied as an apprentice metalsmith before again, coming to a mutual agreement with the company that employment in his position was not best suited to him. However, before Andy left the company, he became interested in motorcycles, due to the building (then) being in close proximity to a local bike showroom, at that time, a local Honda dealers. It was shortly before he left Alchemy, that Andy bought his first motorcycle helmet, and his interest in bikes took off from there.

 Biking Years .

Throughout his search for a new job, Andy's interest in bikes if anything became stronger, and he eventually managed to purchase a second-hand bike, a Honda NSR125.

Andy, or "Squid" as he is known to his friends and employers, is now a keen motorcyclist, and rides his Aprilia RS50 when he can find the keys. He is a regular participant and active member of both the Sheffield Bikers group, and Visordown, both online forums that cater to the needs of motorcyclists. While something of a source of constipation and indeed at times, anger, among members of the Visordown community, Andy's "there is no such thing as black and white" attitude to life, and tolerance of the occasional cutting remark have earned him both friends and respect among the members of both sites.

 The Future .

Andy is continuing to spend time working with various 3D applications and is considering becoming a professional graphics artist. As an alternative however, he has hinted that he may be interested in a military carreer.

An Air Scout Troop can apply to become recognised with the Royal Air Force and thus can receive special opportunities and trips. This RAF Recognition is subject to a regular 18 month inspection by a designated RAF Reserve Officer.

United States of America.
Air Scouts is a now-defunct program of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). The Air Scouts program had four ranks Apprentice, Observer, Craftsman, and Ace. The Ace cloth knot and medal may still be worn by anyone who earned them before the program was dropped.

The program was established in 1941 and existed under the name Air Scouts until 1949, when it was renamed Air Explorers.  With minor changes, this program lasted until 1965, when it was fully merged into the then existing Explorer program of the BSA as a specialty called 'Aviation Explorers'.  It still exists today as part of the BSA's Learning for Life Explorer program.

Youth in the United States of America interested in non-profit organizations based around flying should also look into the Civil Air Patrol Cadet Program.

<doc id="5527990" title="Singapore general election, 1959" nonfiltered="346" processed="343" dbindex="1480348">


The 1959 Singapore legislative assembly general election was a general election held in Singapore on 30 May 1959 to choose the members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore. Under the Constitution of Singapore in 1959, the members of Legislative Assembly was fully determined by the population of Singapore, and the political party who won the majority of the assembly seats would form the ruling government, much like the modern Parliament of Singapore. Candidates were nominated on 25 April 1959 and the actual polls were held on 30 May. The People's Action Party (PAP) eventually won the general election in a landslide, winning 43 out of 51 seats.

The 1959 general election was the PAP's first victory in terms of being the ruling party of Singapore. Presently it continues to be the ruling party of Singapore, and has never lost control of the Singaporean legislature since the 1959 elections. It was the first election after which Singapore officially achieved self rule.

An election of firsts.

The 1959 general election was also the first election to be held since full internal self-government was granted by the British Empire, which Singapore was part of at the time. Compulsory voting was also implemented for the first time. 

Singapore was not fully independent, as the British still controlled external affairs such as the military and foreign relations. However, Singapore was now a recognised state and the entire Legislative Assembly for the first time was wholly determined by the local population. Previously under the Rendel Constitution, which was a 1955 reform of the Constitution of Singapore, the legislature and its leaders could not fully be determined by the population. The British government instead appointed 7 of the 33 total members, although the rest was by election with limited suffrage. This itself was an improvement from the pre-1955 Legislative Council of Singapore when only 6 out of over twenty members were elected.

Campaign issues and platforms.
Discontent with the Labour Front.

The ruling party at the time was the Labour Front, which had won the general election of 1955. David Saul Marshall, who headed the Labour Front in 1955 and was chosen as Chief Minister, had since resigned in 1956. By 1959, the Labour Front was in turmoil, although they had been very successful at campaigning in 1955. Much of the issues resounded around the topic of independence as well as political issues such as the communist insurgency led by the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) which had been causing the Malayan Emergency (1948-1960). 

During the 1955 election, the PAP protested against the existence of appointed members as set forth by the Rendel Constitution, and become the main opposition party following the election, and the  Singapore Progressive Party (SPP) which had been one of the most dominant parties in the 1948 election and the 1951 election had become increasingly displaced at this point. The desire for independence and self-government epitomised by the Malay term Merdeka, had started to become immediate. This was reflected when the cry of "We want Merdeka now!" was taken up by those demanding immediate independence. The SPP fell out of favour as it was perceived by much of the electorate by working for reform too slowly.

David Marshall was vocally anti-British and anti-colonialist, and the British found it difficult to come to an agreement or a compromise. Eventually after failing to reach any agreement about a definite plan for self-government he resigned in 1956, following a pledge that he would achieve self-government or resign. Lim Yew Hock, another Labour Front member, took his place. He pursued an aggressive anti-communist campaign and manage to convince the British to make a definite plan for self-government. The Constitution of Singapore was revised accordingly in 1958, replacing the Rendel Constitution with one that granted Singapore self-government and the ability for its own population to fully elect its Legislative Assembly. 

However, Lim's tactics against the communists alienated a large part of the Singaporean Chinese electorate, the demographic targeted most during the anti-communist campaign. There were also allegations of civil rights violations as many activists were detained without trial with the justification of internal security and tear gas were used against demonstrating students from several Chinese schools, both anti-colonialist and anti-communist alike.

Campaign of the People's Action Party. 


The People's Action Party made an election issue out of the harsh repression by Lim Yew Hock. The PAP was left-wing at the time and attracted many sympathisers. In addition to many left-wing members, there were also many centrist members and a handful of right-wing members at the time. The party was thus able to attract support from a large and diverse electorate.

The PAP pursued an aggressive election campaign which included large rallies and door-to-door campaigning. As the Labour Front government was rife with corruption and perceived misdealing, the PAP capitalised on this by promoting a "corruption-free" image, and its members' white robes were to signify the purity that the PAP declared it had in contrast to the Labour Front. The name of the PAP promising "action" and reform went along with this portrayal. Already a formidable faction at the 1955 general elections, the PAP grew exceptionally popular.

Results.

The voter turnout for the election was 527,919 out of a total 586,098 voters, or 92.9% of the total eligible voters. This was a huge turnout, especially when compared to the 1955 general election in which only 158,075 of 300,199 voters turned out, or 52.7% of the total eligible voters. There were two historical attributions for this. One was the implementation of compulsory voting, the other the removal of suffrage restrictions that had previously limited voting rights to those born in Singapore, or those who had lived there for a certain amount of time.

Over 51 seats were available for contesting during the election, which was almost a 50% increase from the total seats at the 1955 general election, and more than double of the seats if only elected seats are considered. In contrast to the elections that would follow in the future after the 1963 general election, there were no walkovers.



Legacy.

With the successful conclusion of the election, all the members of the Parliament were now elected, and thus theoretically achieved full consent of the governed. The PAP as ruling party was able to form a new government of Singapore on 3 June 1959 that was fully elected which could now adopt domestic policy without oversight from the colonial administration. The United Kingdom still however controlled the military forces, foreign affairs and had a joint responsibility in internal security under agreement. However, the year of the conclusion of the elections and the formation of the new government   1959   is generally the date specified by historians for the achievement of self-government for Singapore, even though the Constitution had been amended in 1958.

Before taking over the governance of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew secured the release of several PAP members, who were arrested under the Emergency Regulation in 1956 and 1957,  including left-wing leader Lim Chin Siong. During the election campaign, Lee had advocated for their release as part of his election platform, and thus was able to mobilise the support of many trade union members. 

After their release, Lim Chin Siong and his affiliates would later challenge Lee's leadership in the PAP, leading to the expulsion of most of the left-wing members from the PAP in 1961. The expelled members formed the Barisan Sosialis, and would contest the 1963 general elections against the PAP. Although having been crippled by Operation Coldstore, they put up a fight that to date, is the only election that threatened to remove the PAP from power while it was an existing ruling party. It however lost and went into a decline, affirming the PAP as ruling party.

By elections.
During the course of the parliament, two by-elections were held:
Singapore by-election, April 1961;
Singapore by-election, July 1961;

<doc id="4102521" title="Glycol cleavage" nonfiltered="347" processed="344" dbindex="1480349">
Glycol cleavage is a specific type of organic chemistry oxidation. The C-C bond between two OH groups is cleaved and replaced with C=O bonds. The ketone is formed on the more highly substituted carbon next to the hydroxyl group being attacked. The aldehyde forms on the less substituted side. 

Glycol cleavage is an important reaction in the laboratory because it is useful for determining the structures of sugars. After cleavage takes place the keto-aldehyde fragments can be inspected and the location of the former hydroxyl groups ascertained. 

Reagents.

Periodic acid (HIO4) is one of the most convenient ways to cleave a glycol. It is thought to involve a cyclic periodate intermediate which then stabilizes into a keto-aldehyde. Periodic cleavage of a glycol yields the same result as ozonolysis reduction of an alkene (followed by dimethyl sulfate).

Warm and concentrated potassium permanganate (KMnO4) will react with an alkene to form a glycol and will then immediately cleave the glycol to give a stable ketone and an oxidizable aldehyde. The aldehyde reacts to become a carboxylic acid. Controlling the temperature and concentration of the reagent can keep the reaction from continuing past the formation of the glycol.

Nomenclature.
The term glycol means a 1,2-diol, also called a vicinal diol. This indicates a molecular structure consisting of two hydroxyl (OH) groups on adjacent (hence 1,2) carbon atoms. Common glycols are ethylene glycol (antifreeze) and propylene glycol (used in medicine and foods).

Synthesis of Glycols.
Glycols can be synthesized by the hydroxylation of alkenes. Hydroxyl groups are added across the double bond yielding cis stereochemistry. This oxidation reaction can be accomplished with osmium tetroxide (OsO4) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Cold, dilute potassium permanganate (KMnO4) followed by a strong base (HO-) will yield the same result with reduced yields.

Bishop Elliott G. Thomas is a bishop in the Roman Catholic Church.

He was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on July 25, 1926. Thomas's family had lived in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, returning there in 1934. Elliott Thomas was enrolled in the Methodist Day School in Road Town and as a teenager attended Charlotte Amalie High School in St. Thomas, where he graduated in 1945.

Following his graduation, he served as a Clerk of the Municipal Homestead Commission and Clerk of the Adult Evening School in St. Thomas. In 1945, he enrolled in the College of Pharmacy at Howard University in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in 1950. After qualifying as a registered pharmacist in Detroit, Michigan he joined the United States Army and was assigned to FranMort-Hoechst and to Munich, Germany.

After returning to the Virgin Islands, he became a pharmacist in St. Thomas. From 1954 - 1959, he worked as a pharmacist with the Veterans Administration in Erie, Pennsylvania, where he also studied part-time at Gannon College, majoring in Business Administration.

On October 2, 1957 he converted to Catholicism and was received into the Church at St. Peter's Cathedral in Erie, Pennsylvania. He began his studies for the priesthood in 1982 at St. Vincent de Paul Regional Seminary in Boynton Beach, Florida. He was ordained to the priesthood for the Diocese of St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands on June 6, 1986, and was appointed Episcopal Vicar for the Diocese and pastor of Holy Family Church.

Father Thomas served as pastor of St. Ann's Church on St. Croix, pastor of Holy Family Church, Dean of the Diocese and the Vicar General. The Diocesan Consulters of the Diocese of St. Thomas unanimously elected Father Thomas to serve as Diocesan Administrator, a post he filled from August 11, 1992 until he was named as the Third Bishop of the Virgin Islands on October 30, 1993. He was consecrated and installed at Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral on Sunday, December 12, 1993.

The   (or P.W.A.B.) is a fictional secret society in the Guilty Gear fighting game series, making its first appearance in Guilty Gear XX. It is the organization that created Robo-Ky, and changed Testament into a Gear.

 Background .
Very little is known of the organization, apart from the above. However, each character's Story Mode provides some hints as to their purpose.


The organization was founded during the war between humans and Gears; as its name implies, it was intended to manage the affairs of the human race once the war was over. However, the war's end saw no need for them, and it was supposed to have been disbanded. Instead, they merely retreated to the shadows.

The group demonstrably has access to relatively advanced technology, as it created Robo-Ky. However, its members can also use magic; an unidentified member of the group used a crystal ball to observe Jam Kuradoberi in one of her endings.

The purpose of the organization has apparently shifted entirely to maintaining its own power and influence, as well as its own secrecy, and its members are willing to go to any lengths to do so, evidently lacking any ethics in how they go about this. Its interest in each character seems focused on whether they should be manipulated, killed, captured, or studied, and each characters' Story Mode begins with the P.W.A.B.'s profile for that character, accompanied with a "risk rating" that apparently denotes how dangerous they are to the organization. Robo-Ky was created both to impersonate Ky Kiske and as an equalizer should they decide that direct confrontation is necessary.

"Nadia's Theme" is a piece of music composed by Barry De Vorzon and Perry Botkin, Jr. that currently serves as the theme music to the American soap opera The Young and the Restless.

The melody, originally called "Cotton's Dream," was written by De Vorzon and Botkin as incidental music for the 1971 theatrical film Bless the Beasts and Children. Two years later, Botkin wrote a rearranged version of the piece for The Young and the Restless; the show debuted on March 23, 1973. The melody was later renamed "Nadia's Theme" after the ABC television network set Romanian gymnast Nadia Comaneci's performance to that music during the 1976 Summer Olympics.

About one month after the 1976 Olympics, the song was released as a single by A&M Records. It soared to up to position number 8 on the Billboard Music Charts by December of 1976, in part because of its association with Comaneci. However, A&M Records failed to credit De Vorzon as the co-writer on the first pressings of the single; he successfully sued the record label for $241,000 USD.  Currently, the single has never been released on CD.

Other versions of "Nadia's Theme" have been recorded, including a semi-rock version by The Ventures, and  David Hasselhoff's rendition for his 1987 album Lovin' Feelings.

"Nadia's Theme" is sampled in Mary J. Blige's single No More Drama from her album with the same name. In the tune, Blige's persona describes herself as "young and restless".

PatrolBot is a programmable autonomous general purpose Service robot rover built by MobileRobots Inc. In various configurations, PatrolBots serve as bases for companies developing delivery robots, security robots, environmental monitoring rovers, guides and other indoor service robots.

 Capabilities of PatrolBot .

PatrolBot can scan buildings, create floor plans and navigate them autonomously using a laser range-finding sensor inside the robot. It employs Monte Carlo/Markov-style localization techniques and using a modified value-iterated search technique for navigation. It searches for alternative paths if a hall is blocked, circumnavigates obstacles and re-charges itself at its automated dock/charge station as needed. As a Wi-Fi device, it can operate autonomously or be controlled remotely.

 Applications .

PatrolBot is a robotic base used to integrate with security alarms, HVAC systems, electronic doors, elevators and other enterprise systems in a facility. It is programmable for custom applications, but also offers canned applications for surveillance, security, sensor monitoring, hazard detection and delivery.

Outfitted as a Surveillance PatrolBot, the device provides remote viewing and 2-way audio through camera, microphone and speakers. It can be controlled manually or autonomously from networked control stations. Intruders are visible by the path they leave as they walk, artifacts of the laser. A gas sensor reads oxygen, CO2 and H2S levels and can sound alarm on the robot and/or at the control station if acceptable levels are exceeded; likewise for smoke and temperature. PatrolBot is unique in that it is designed to have additional sensors, crates and devices added to it and to its GUI Control software.

PatrolBot can be sent to goals on demand or can patrol a sequence of goals. Status windows in the control GUI provide read-outs from the sensors as well as proprioceptive information such as battery levels. The robot's data logs are available for security and energy optimization.

Morton's neuroma (also known as  Morton's metatarsalgia, Morton's neuralgia, plantar neuroma and intermetatarsal neuroma) is a benign neuroma of the interdigital plantar nerve. 

This problem is characterised by numbness and pain, relieved by removing footwear.

Although it is labeled a "neuroma", many sources do not consider it a true tumor, but rather a thickening of existing tissue.

Symptoms and signs.
Symptoms include: pain on weight bearing, frequently after only a short time; the pain is felt as a shooting pain affecting the contiguous halves of two toes. Burning, numbness and parasthesia may also be experienced. Classically the 3rd digital space between the 3rd and 4th toes are affected, but the condition can occasionally occur in the 2nd and 3rd interdigital space. The pain is caused by pressure on the enlarged section of nerve where it passes between the metatarsal heads, and is squeezed between them. The first toe is never involved. Neuroma in the 4th/5th interdigital space is described, but is extremely rare. 

Negative signs include no obvious deformities, erythema, signs of inflammation or limitation of movement. Direct pressure between the metatarsal heads will replicate the symptoms, as will compression of the forefoot between the finger and thumb so as to compress the transverse arch of the foot

There are other causes of pain in the forefoot.  Too often all forefoot pain is categorized as neuroma.  Other conditions to consider are capsulitis, which is an inflammation of ligaments that surrounds two bones, at the level of the joint.  In this case it would the ligaments that attach the toe bone to the metatarsal bone.  Inflammation from this condition will put pressure on an otherwise healthy nerve and give neuroma type symptoms.
Additionally, an intermetatarsal bursitis between the third and fourth metatarsal bones will also give neuroma type symptoms because it too puts pressure on the nerve.

Since a neuroma is a soft tissue condition an MRI should be helpful in diagnosis, however, often an MRI will be inconclusive for neuroma even though a neuroma exists.

Moses Harris (1731 - 1785) was an English entomologist and engraver.

In the Natural System of Colours (1766) he examined the work of Isaac Newton and tried to reveal the multitude of colours which can be created from three basic ones. As a naturalist, Harris wished to understand the relationships between the colours, and how they are coded, and his book attempted to explain the principles, "materially, or by the painters art", by which further colours can be produced from red, yellow and blue. Harris showed what is now known as the subtractive mixing of colours, with his most important observation showing that black will be formed through the superimposition of the three basic colours.

Late Night with Butt-Head is an episode of the animated series Beavis and Butt-head, from the fourth season.

Synopsis.


Beavis and Butt-head are watching an episode of Late Show with David Letterman, which inspires Butt-head to come up with a similar show.  The duo visits the audio-visual department at school, where Mr. Van Driessen is apparently teaching a journalism class.  Butt-head explains to Van Driessen his idea, which the viewer sees in the form of a daydream of Butt-head as David Letterman and Beavis as Paul Shaffer.  The duo then proceed to do their own crude rendition of the show in a classroom as another student records it.

 Trivia .
The segment featuring the boys watching Letterman, in which his voice is actually featured, was cut out of the DVD release; the episode occasionally airs in its entirety on MTV2.

The Pacific viperfish, Chauliodus macouni, is a predatory fish living deep in the oceans and is frequently referred to as among the ocean's "bottom feeders." In daytime it can be found from 500 2500 m below the ocean surface. At night it swims up into shallower depths of less than 600m where food is more plentiful.  Pacific viperfish will mostly eat crustaceans and small fish. They typically reach lengths of up to 30 cm, however they can reach up to 2 m and are considered an example of deep-sea gigantism. It is believed that its first dorsal fin's photophores are used to attract prey.

Pacific viperfish can be characterized by its large mouth, long fang-like teeth and long dorsal fin ray (as much as half its body length). They are iridescent dark silver-blue color in life with pale fins.

<doc id="445017" title="M50 Reising submachine gun" nonfiltered="373" processed="370" dbindex="1480375">


The Reising was an American submachine gun patented in 1940 and manufactured by Harrington & Richardson. It was designed by Eugene Reising in 1940. The two versions of the weapon produced during World War II were the M50 and the simplified folding-stock M55.  Over 10,000 guns were ordered, and were initially used by the United States Navy and Marine Corps, though some went to Canadian, Soviet, and other forces.

Design.
Though described as a submachine gun, the Reising was actually designed as a compact lightweight semi-automatic carbine that was also capable of fully-automatic fire.  There were three versions of the Reising, the M50, M55, and the semi-automatic-only M60.
  
There were several differences between the M50 and the M55.  The most obvious one was the use of a rather flimsy, folding wire buttstock in the M55.  The latter also eliminated the flash suppressor and was simplified internally, making it lighter and shorter, with a reduced rate of fire. The M55 was originally issued to Marine parachute troops and armored vehicle crews.  The M60 was designed primarily for police use as a semi-automatic carbine.

History.
The Reising entered service primarily because of uncertainty of supply of sufficient quantities of the Thompson submachine gun. In the testing stage, it won out over some other candidates. It was very light and quite accurate in aimed fire, attributed to its better stock fit and intricate closed bolt design, though its firepower was more limited due to the 20-round capacity of its largest magazine. 

During WWII, quantities of the M50 Reising gun were issued to U.S. Marine Corps personnel deploying to the Pacific theatre, and were used in the Solomons campaign, including the battle for Guadalcanal. Most Reisings were originally issued to Marine officers and NCOs in lieu of a compact and light carbine, since the M1 Carbine was not yet being issued to the Marines.  Although the Thompson submachine gun was available, this weapon frequently proved too heavy and bulky for jungle patrols, and initially it too was in short supply. 

The Para-Marines were known to have been issued quantities of the folding-stock M55, but the weapon's poorly-designed wire-framed stock (which tended to collapse upon firing) soon earned the weapon a poor reputation.    

Unfortunately, the Reising was not suited to the stresses of harsh battle conditions encountered in the Solomon Islands   namely, the difficulty in keeping the weapon clean enough to function properly.  While more accurate than the Thompson, particularly in semi-auto fire, the Reising had a tendency to jam.  This was in part due to its overly complex locked-breech design. This design used a system of levers within the breech block, to release the firing pin, that rusted easily in jungle climates.  The Reising soon earned a dismal reputation for reliability. Reportedly, many Marines would throw the weapon away upon finding just about anything else, and one NCO reportedly 'decommissioned' his Reising by breaking the stock over the head of a particularly insolent 'brig rat'. Lt. Col. Merritt Edson, commanding officer of a Marine Raider battalion, ordered all Reising submachine guns issued to his unit to be dumped unceremoniously in a river, so that his men might draw better weapons.

After the Marines proved reluctant to accept more Reisings, and with the increased issue of the .30 M1 Carbine, the U.S. government passed some Reising submachine guns to the OSS and to various foreign governments (as Lend-Lease aid).  Others were given to various anti-Axis resistance forces operating around the world.  Many Reising guns (particularly the M60 variant) were also released to U.S. law enforcement and the National Guard for guarding war plants, bridges, and other strategic resources, and in this role the weapon proved more successful.

Variants.
Harrington & Richardson also made a long-barreled, semi-automatic version, known as the M60 carbine. However, few of these were sold. The Marines used M60s for training, guard duty and other non-combat roles. Some M60s were believed to have been issued to Marine officers at Guadalcanal.  The remaining guns were passed on to the National Guard and civilian law enforcement agencies.

Töölö (Swedish Tölö) is the collective name for the districts Etu-Töölö (Swedish Främre Tölö) and Taka-Töölö (Swedish Bortre Tölö) in Helsinki, Finland. The districts are located next to the city centre, occupying the western side of the Helsinki Peninsula.

Etu-Töölö, the southern district, borders Kamppi and is the location of the Finnish Parliament House. Taka-Töölö, the northern district, borders Meilahti and Laakso. Contrary to popular belief, Töölö is not the official name of any district in Helsinki.

Töölö was built in 1920-1930 when Helsinki suffered from rapid population growth and needed more housing. Before that, Töölö was full of farms and some forest.

Töölö has always been respected as a district and the prices of apartments are high especially in Etu-Töölö. It has many parks, including the big Töölönlahti (Gulf of Töölö). Töölö also has a vibrant culture. It has the National Opera, The National Museum Of Finland, Kunsthalle Helsinki, the Zoological Museum and many small galleries.

Notable sights.
Töölö has parks such as Sibelius-puisto, which has a monument to the composer Jean Sibelius. There are also other sights and buildings of architectural interest, as well as renowned hotels and restaurants in Töölö.

<doc id="7884430" title="Spires of Naples" nonfiltered="382" processed="379" dbindex="1480384">




The Spires of Naples ("spire" in Italian: guglia; plural, guglie) are three monument columns in the historic center of the city of Naples. The term "plague column" is commonly used in English for such structures since in many places in Europe such columns were built to celebrate the end of or deliverance from the plague. They were common in the Catholic countries of Europe especially in the 17th and 18th centuries, when their ornateness became one of the most visible features of Baroque architecture. The columns may also be termed "votive columns" or "votive spires" and may also be connected with calamities other than the plague, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions, or may simply be manifestations of faith, atonement, or expiation. Such columns are generally surmounted by a statue of a religious personage. In Naples, the spires are named for the religious figure that tops them. In chronological order by date of completion, the spires are:


the Spire of San Gennaro, (started in 1636  and finished by 1650) in the square of Sisto Riario Sforza. It was the work of Cosimo Fanzago, perhaps the greatest architect of the Neapolitan Baroque. The spire was erected to celebrate the deliverance of the city from the great earthquake of 1631. ;


the Spire of San Domenico, located in the square of San Domenico Maggiore. The name refers to San Domenico di Guzman, founder of the Dominican Order. The spire was started after the plague of 1656; the designer, again, was Cosimo Fanzago. The work, itself, was undertaken by royal architect, Francesco Antonio Picchiati whose concern for documenting and preserving the great number of remains of the ancient Roman city of Neapolis beneath the site caused construction to be suspended in 1680 when the spire had reached only about half the height one sees today. It was finished by the architect Domenico Antonio Vaccaro in 1737 under Charles III, the first Bourbon monarch of Naples. By definition, this spire is the only true "plague column" of the three.


the Spire of the Immaculate Virgin, located in the center of the square of Piazza del Gesù Nuovo. It was erected in 1750 under Charles III after a building time of only three years. It was built at the behest of the king after he commented that the people should have some means of admiring the statue of the Immaculate Virgin without having to go into the church of Gesù (now called Gesù Nuovo) on the square, where the statue was contained. Jesuit Father Francesco Pepe refused royal patronage and financed the construction of the spire through public donations. The spire was designed by Giuseppe Genoino and the main sculptors were Matteo Bottiglieri and Francesco Pagano. The rich ornamentation of the spire is considered the epitome of Neapolitan Baroque sculpture.  Building was facilitated by the existence of a preexisting monument on the site, an equestrian statue of Philip V of Spain, partially destroyed in 1705 after the end of the Spanish vicerealm in Naples.    ;

<doc id="1096607" title="Feminist legal theory" nonfiltered="383" processed="380" dbindex="1480385">
Feminist legal theory is based on the belief that the law has been instrumental in women's historical subordination.  The project of feminist legal theory is twofold.  First, feminist jurisprudence seeks to explain ways in which the law plays a role in women's subordinate status. Second, feminist legal theory is dedicated to changing women's status through a reworking of the law and its approach to gender.    

The four primary approaches to feminist jurisprudence are: the liberal equality model, the sexual difference model, the dominance model, and the postmodern or anti-essentialist model. Each model provides a distinct view of the legal mechanisms that contribute to women's subordination, and each offers a distinct method for changing legal approaches to gender.  

The liberal equality model operates from within the liberal legal paradigm and generally embraces liberal values and the rights-based approach to law, though it takes issue with how the liberal framework has operated in practice.  This model focuses on ensuring that women are afforded genuine equality as opposed to the nominal equality often given them in the traditional liberal framework and seeks to achieve this either by way of a more thorough application of liberal values to women s experiences or the revision of liberal categories to take gender into account.  Susan Okin, for example, has critiqued liberal approaches to justice for their complete neglect of gender and its injustice.  

The difference model emphasizes the significance of the differences between men and women and holds that these differences should not be obscured by the law, but should be taken into account by it.  Only by taking into account differences can the law provide adequate remedies for women s situation, which is in fact distinct from men s.  The difference model is in direct opposition to the sameness account which holds that women s sameness to men should be emphasized. To the sameness feminist, employing women s differences in an attempt to garner greater rights is ineffective and places emphasis on the very characteristics of women that have historically precluded them from achieving equality to men.

The dominance model and its most notable proponent, Catharine MacKinnon, reject liberal feminism and view the legal system as a mechanism for the perpetuation of male dominance.  Sexuality is central to MacKinnon s dominance account.  She argues that women s sexuality is socially constructed by male dominance and that women s subordination results primarily from the sexual dominance of women by men.  A major line of critique of the dominance model is that it leaves no room for women s agency since women are victims whose lives are fundamentally shaped by male dominance.  The difficulty of the dominance model is that it leaves little or no room for women s genuine autonomy or agency.

Feminists from the postmodern camp have deconstructed the notions of objectivity and neutrality, claiming that every perspective is socially situated.  Anti-essentialist and intersectionalist critiques of feminist jurisprudence have objected to the idea that there can be any universal women s voice and have criticized feminists for implicitly basing their work on the experiences of white, middle class, heterosexual women.  The anti-essentialist and intersectionalist project has been to explore the ways in which race, class, sexual orientation, and other axes of subordination interplay with gender and to uncover the implicit, detrimental assumptions that have often been employed in feminist theory.

BAMZOOKi is a Mixed Reality television gameshow on the BBC which features a toolkit developed by Gameware Development. The first series aired in March 2004 on CBBC. The show is currently presented by Jake Humphrey and Richard Webb.

 ZOOKs .

A ZOOK is an autonomous creature designed by users and contestants in the gameshow. Created using 3D primitives, ZOOKs move autonomously based on IK points that the designer assigns to them.

Using nature as inspiration, contestants design ZOOKs to compete against other ZOOKs in a variety of competitions. The tool kit for designing ZOOKs is offered for download on the show's website. Also, more recently, two new ZOOK-Kit features have been released that allow users to simulate the TV contests and then replay their ZOOKs' performances from multiple angles.

Gameware's Creature Labs team uses artificial life programming techniques to provide the ZOOKs' autonomous movement and behaviour and integrates this with the BBC's virtual studio system to enable real-time visualisations in a studio setting.

 In more detail... .
The toolkit, the BAMZOOKi Zook Kit, enables users to build virtual creatures, ZOOKs, and test them in a realtime physically simulated environment. Kids used this software to build ZOOKs which were submitted to the BBC. Teams were selected and invited into the studio to enter their ZOOKs in various contests from bowling to hurdles.

The software is still freely available from the BBC site along with the manual. Although designed to be easy enough to be used by kids, it is highly flexible and versatile. Zooks are built from the bottom-up with elemetary component parts that the user shapes and sticks together. Users are not restricted to particular body designs or topologies, although the control system uses a standard Braitenberg architecture.

The BBC's Virtual Studio technology was used to enable realtime composition of the 3D rendered graphics with live camera feeds. Each studio camera has a dedicated render PC to render the virtual scene from that camera's perspective. To know what a studio camera's perspective is, each camera is fitted with a second 'Free-D' camera which points towards the ceiling. On the ceiling are reflective, circular bar codes. The Free-D camera data is fed to a computer system that identifies the targets on the ceiling and calculates that camera's position and orientation, 50 times a second.

The contest runs in realtime on a networked PC. All the clients receive contest scene information and render their scene from their studio camera's point of view. A bank of chromakey boxes then composite the virtual and the live feed together to provide a realtime composite. This video stream can be sent to the studio camera monitors so that camera operators can view the composite and hence follow the action in realtime.

There is a non-children's user-base establishing itself, using the toolkit (a modified version of the Bonsai artificial life program) for their own purposes.

Presently when you download the Zook Kit it comes with the Simulator ( for doing chalenges like on TV ) and the Motion Player to watch your battles from the Simulator.

A Kebab rat is a pejorative term used in the East End of London to describe unclean vermin meat that has been processed to form döner kebab meats. Since the processing and production of meat for consumption as kebabs is normally limited to lamb, beef, chicken or occasionally fish, the use of vermin meat is considered unsafe and in many countries illegal. The vermin meat is supposedly ground and mixed with proper meats before being processed into the large slab of meat which is fed onto a vertical spindle and grilled before being served.

The term originated in a local newspaper, the Hackney Gazette in 2003, in an article covering the closure of a kebab house in Tottenham, although it is likely it had already entered popular use by locals beforehand to describe the products of disreputable meat preparation companies and slaughterhouses.

As of 2005, there have been no known instances of food preparation companies being closed or prosecuted due to the use of vermin meat in edible products in London, which might suggest that the term is unwarranted and potentially slanderous. It is believed that reports of food poisoning from local kebab shops become distorted and foster this urban myth.

In the UK selling rodent meat in kebabs is likely to be incompatible with current Meat Regulations and would likely require a Novel food pre-market safety assessment under european legislation should a kebab shop wish to sell it legally.

Jetton graduated from Charleston High School in 1986. He attended Cape Girardeau public schools from 6th to 9th grade but transferred during his freshman year when his father became pastor of Southside Baptist Church in Charleston. He was a four-year letterman on the cross country and track teams, and set the school two mile record with a time of 9:52. He enjoys music and singing and he played Sky Masterson in the school musical Guys and Dolls his senior year. He was also the senior class treasurer.
     
Jetton was awarded a college scholarship for cross country and track to attend Southwest Baptist University in Bolivar, Missouri. He graduated in May 1990, with a double major in history and political science. He was a 4-year letterman and captain of the cross country and track teams.  His first interest in politics started in student government where he was elected to several offices ending his service as the Student Body President his senior year.
     
Jetton joined the United States Marine Corps and served as an Infantry Officer for four years. He was stationed at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina and was involved in the Bosnia and Somalia operations. After finishing his tour in 1995, Rod received an honorable discharge.

After leaving the Marine Corps, Rod started Jetton James Real Estate Company with his father-in-law.

Public service.

After college, Jetton joined Congressman Bill Emerson's campaign team as a field coordinator, and gained valuable experience in local grass roots politics.  In 1996, he was elected to the Bollinger County Commission as the youngest County Commissioner in the state at that time. Bollinger County remained in the black during his term.  Jetton held town hall meetings throughout the district and wrote a column in the newspaper.
     
In 2000, Jetton was elected to the Missouri House of Representatives where he has served since 2001. In his second term, he was chosen Speaker Pro Tem of the Missouri House. On January 5, 2005, he was sworn in as the 70th Speaker of the Missouri House of Representatives.

Jetton states that his priorities include improving the economic climate in the state, reform of a runaway legal system, ensuring quality medical care for all Missourians and giving every child an excellent education.  He asserts that he is working to bring a more bi-partisan environment to the legislature, and has changed the legislative process to make sure everyone's voices are heard.

Jetton is a member of New Salem Baptist Church, Chamber of Commerce, Optimist Club, Christian Coalition, VFW Post 5900, Farm Bureau, National Rifle Association and National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB). The Bollinger County Chamber of Commerce gave him the "One Year VIP Business Achievement Award" in 1998 for his leadership and service to the community.
     
Family.

In 1988, Jetton married Cassie James.  Together they are raising three children, Callie, Elaine and Will. Cassie has been a full partner with Rod in caring for the household and the children when he was away on deployments while in the Marine Corps. Now that Rod is serving the public, she manages the apprasial company and has been instrumental in its success.

Go Home Lake is a lake in west central Ontario in the Township of Georgian Bay, District of Muskoka. Fur traders would meet on Go Home Lake at the end of the season to "go home", hence the name. Go Home Lake is approximately 5 miles long and ranges from a 1/2 to 3/4 miles wide. Its length runs in a north-south orientation. The lake is fed at its most northern point by the Moon River. Go Home Lake empties into the Gibson River at the south end of the lake as well as into the Go Home River at the north end of the lake. Both The Gibson River and the Go Home River empty into Georgian Bay. Go Home Lake was opened up and divided into lots which were sold beginning in 1958-59. Go Home Lake is considerably more rugged and rockier than other Muskoka lakes. Both the "New Cut" (a man made channel), and the "Haunted Narrows" link the south end of the lake to the north.     The "Haunted Narrows" received its name from the eerie sound caused by the movement of rocks on the bottom of the channel that can be heard in the dead of night.

The Nissan Pao is a retro-styled automobile from Nissan Motors. It was produced as an enclosed hatchback or open canvas-topped convertible. The Pao was one of three fashionable spinoffs of the K10 Micra   the Figaro and Be-1 being the other two. Like the Figaro, the Pao was sold without the Nissan name, by reservation from January 15 through April 14, 1989.

The engine was the 1.0 L (987 cc) MA10S, and a 3-speed automatic transmission or 5-speed manual transmission was also supplied.  This engine produced 52 PS (51 hp/38 kW) at 6000 rpm and 76 N·m (56 ft·lbf) at 3600 rpm.

It was designed as a fashionable city car in the mold of the Figaro, requiring just 4.4 m (14.4 ft) to turn around and delivering up to 43 mpg (5.5 L/100 km) in the city and 69 mpg (3.4 L/100 km) at a steady 60 km/h (37 mph).

The chassis included rack and pinion steering, independent suspension with struts in front and 4-links and coil springs in back.  Disc brakes were used all around.

 Outline and features .

(Rough interpretation from a document translated from Japanese)

Summary and features for type E-PK10. The pike is the K10 and also type March. 

Always designed to produce a feeling of a car that is different, it has the taste of being on holiday while being practical for everyday driving in the city. Naturalness (meaning a lack of obvious use of computer-aided design) and an impression of good quality were wanted along with making you fall in love with it. Remeniscent of an Austin A-40 Farina of the late 1960s, the very first hatchback in the world.

Designed to express the true heart of the city it is based on a 2-box design. The appearance is both eye-catching and simple, warm but very cool.

Some panels are made from (injection molding) the thermoplastic resin, others from SMC formation resin (FPR) the thermosetting metaplasia resin using Japanese engineered stiffening ribs for the bonnet. These lightweight parts used with the single sided processing steel sheet also improves corrosion resistance substantially, overall strength and rigidity.

Rust prevention is further enhanced by the used of electronic rustproofing in hollow areas, filling spaces with rust-prevention wax, and the use of processes which raise the adhesion properties of the paint

Senegal has well-trained and disciplined armed forces consisting of about 19,000 personnel in the army, air force, navy, and gendarmerie. The Senegalese military force receives most of its training, equipment, and support from France and the United States. Germany also provides support but on a smaller scale. Military noninterference in political affairs has contributed to Senegal's stability since independence. Senegal has participated in many international and regional peacekeeping missions. Most recently, in 2000, Senegal sent a battalion to the Democratic Republic of Congo to participate in MONUC, the United Nations peacekeeping mission, and agreed to deploy a U.S.-trained battalion to Sierra Leone to participate in UNAMSIL, another UN peacekeeping mission. A Senegalese contingent deployed on a peacekeeping mission to the Central African Republic in 1997, and in 1994, Senegal sent a battalion-sized force to Rwanda to participate in the UN peacekeeping mission there. In 1992 Senegal sent 1,500 men to the ECOMOG peacekeeping group in Liberia, and in 1991, it was the only Sub-Saharan nation to send a contingent to participate in Operation Desert Storm. In August 1981, the Senegalese military was invited into The Gambia by President Dawda Kairaba Jawara to put down a coup attempt. In August 1989, Senegalese-Gambian military cooperation, which began with the joint Senegalese-Gambian efforts during the 1981 coup attempt, ceased with the dissolution of the Senegambian Confederation. Senegal intervened in the Guinea-Bissau civil war in 1998 at the request of former President Vieira.

<doc id="40365" title="Galvanometer" nonfiltered="395" processed="392" dbindex="1480397">



A galvanometer is an instrument for detecting and measuring electric current. It is an electromechanical transducer that produces a rotary deflection, through a limited arc, in response to electric current flowing through its coil. The name galvanometer has been applied to devices used in measuring, recording, and positioning equipment.

 Operation .

The most familiar use is as an analog measuring instrument, often called a meter. It is used to measure the direct current (flow of electric charges) through an electric circuit.  Such devices are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire in the field of a permanent magnet.  The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale.  A tiny spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.  In some meters, the magnetic field acts on a small piece of iron to perform the same effect as a spring.

When a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field.  This field acts with or against the permanent magnet.  The coil pivots, pushing against the spring, and moving the pointer.  The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. A useful meter generally contains some provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer so that the pointer position smoothly tracks the current without excess vibration.


The basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100 microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts, allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in  series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously-unknown resistor.

Because the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter, parallax error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that "lines up" with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by moving the head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any parallax error has been minimized.

 Types . 

Extremely sensitive measuring equipment once used mirror galvanometers that substituted a mirror for the pointer.  A beam of light reflected from the mirror acted as a long, massless pointer. Such instruments were used as receivers for early trans-Atlantic telegraph systems, for instance. The moving beam of light could also be used to make a record on a moving photographic film, producing a graph of current versus time, in a device called an oscillograph.

Galvanometer mechanisms are used to position the pens of analog chart recorders such as used for making an electrocardiogram. Strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens might have a full scale frequency response of 100 Hz and several centimeters deflection. In some cases (the classical polygraph of movies or the electroencephalograph), the galvanometer is strong enough to move the pen while it remains in contact with the paper; the writing mechanism may be a heated tip on the needle writing on heat-sensitive paper or a fluid-fed pen. In other cases (the Rustrak recorders), the needle is only intermittently pressed against the writing medium; at that moment, an impression is made and then the pressure is removed, allowing the needle to move to a new position and the cycle repeats. In this case, the galvanometer need not be especially strong.

 Uses .

Mirror galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning elements in laser optical systems. These are typically high power galvanometer mechanisms used with closed loop servo control systems. They can have frequency responses over 1 kHz.

Galvanometers have been replaced as measuring instruments by analog to digital converters (ADC) for most uses. There are, for instance, self contained digital measuring systems, called digital panel meters (DPMs), available to replace most traditional analog meter functions.

 History .

The term "galvanometer" derives from the surname of Luigi Galvani. Many early applications of galvanometers for measuring and recording are associated with William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). The earliest galvanometer was reported by Johann (Johan) Schweigger of Nuremberg at the University of Halle on 16th September 1820. André-Marie Ampère also contributed to the development of the galvanometer.

Gobi Gurvansaikhan National Park is a national park in southern Mongolia.  The park was established in 1993, and expanded to its current size in 2000.  The park, at nearly 27,000 square kilometers, is the largest national park in Mongolia.

The park is named for the Gurvansaikhan Mountains, which translates to the Three Beauties.  The name is derived from three subranges, the East, Middle and West Beauty.  The range forms the eastern half of the park.

The park lies on the northern edge of the Gobi desert.  The higher elevations contain areas of steppe.  A number of rare plants and animals are found in the park, including the elusive snow leopard.  Areas of sand dunes are found, most famously the Khongoryn Els - the Singing Sands.  Another major tourist destination is Yoliin Am, a mountain valley that contains a large ice field through most of the year.

The park is usually accessed via the town Dalanzadgad, which has airport service to Ulaanbaatar.

stic.man (born Clayton Gavin, 1975, Shadeville, Florida, USA) is a rapper, activist and author known for his work as one half of the political hip-hop duo dead prez.  He is known largely for their hard-hitting style and politically active lyrics, focusing on racism, critical pedagogy, activism against governmental hypocrisy, and corporate control over the media, especially hip-hop record labels. dead prez made their stance clear on their first album, declaring on the lead song, "I'm a African" that the group is "somewhere between N.W.A. and P.E.".

He used to relax on the campus of FAMU though he was never enrolled for classes. There he and M-1 met and connected due to their mutual love of music and knowledge.  The two comrades' growing sense of Black pride and political theory served as a common bond as they joined various community groups, eventually forming dead prez as a rap group and moving to New York. After a chance meeting with Brand Nubian's Lord Jamar at a Brooklyn block party, the duo signed a recording deal with Loud Records, which released Let's Get Free. But even before the release of the record, dead prez amassed a strong and loyal underground following through their explosive live shows, ardent community organizing and top notch unreleased material.

"I don't really consider myself no producer, but I have fun trying to make music that I wanna hear," confesses stic. "We work with live musicians as well as beat machines. We lay the foundation. We might lay some drums, and then build, either getting samples or some type of rhythm in the instruments, or we might come up with a melody. A lot of times the melody is he first thing for me in terms of creating a song. I just start singing some shit and then we start". 

In 2006 stic.man demonstrated his writing talents with two books. The first, entitled Warrior Names from Afrika, is a compilation of African warrior names and their meanings. His second book, The Art of Emcee-ing, is a 112-page resource that offers a step-by-step instructional guide on how to emcee, unique tips on voice healing and vocal health practices, and an explanation on many aspects of the hip hop industry, including terminology, styles, and business dealings. About.com described the book as a "succinct panoramic guide on hip-hop wordsmithing." 

stic.man also maintains Boss Up, Inc., an "Atlanta-based music and entertainment company that offers information, music, and gear that reflects a sense of self-determination, creative consciousness, and entrepreneurship."

James Alfred Farr (born Friday, May 18, 1956 in Waverly, New York) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Texas Rangers in 1982. He was 6 ft 1 in, 195 pounds, and he threw and batted right handed. Farr attend Penn State University.

Farr was drafted three times before signing with a team. In 1974, the Chicago White Sox took him in the 9th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft. In 1977, the San Francisco Giants took him in the 15th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft. Finally, in 1978, the Texas Rangers took him in the 29th round of the June Regular Phase amateur entry draft.

On September 7 1982 at the age of 26 and wearing the number 33, Farr made his Major League debut. He appeared in a total of 5 games in the 1982 season, pitching a total of 18 innings and collecting a good ERA of 2.50. One of the knocks against him-and this may have limited his time in the Major Leagues-was his lack of control. In those 18 innings pitched, Farr threw one wild pitch, walked 13, and struck out only 12. One wild pitch pitch every 18 innings might not seem like a lot, but when comparing him to pitchers like Carlos Silva-who did not throw a single wild pitch in over 188 innings of work in 2005-it is a fairly large amount. 

Less than one month after his debut-on October 3, 1982, Farr pitched his final Major League game.

John Richard Archer (8 June, 1863 July, 1932) was a British race and political activist. In November 1906, he and Sylvester Williams became the first people of African descent to be elected to public office in Britain, with Archer becoming a councillor and later Mayor in Battersea.

Archer was born to Richard Archer, from Barbados, and Mary Teresa Burns, from Ireland, in Liverpool. He travelled the world as a seaman, living in the USA and Canada, then settled in Battersea with his wife, Bertha, a black Canadian. He ran a small photographic studio at a time when photography was in its infancy.

Archer became involved in local politics and friendly with London radicals. In 1906 he was elected as a Liberal to Battersea Borough Council for Latchmere ward; at the same time, Williams won in Marylebone. He successfully campaigned for a minimum wage of 32 shillings a week for council workers and was re-elected in 1912. In 1913, he was nominated for the position of Mayor. There were negative, even racist, aspects to the campaign, with allegations that he did not have British nationality. He won by 40 votes to 39 and gave a notable victory speech:

"My election tonight means a new era. You have made history tonight. For the first time in the history of the English nation a man of colour has been elected as mayor of an English borough.

"That will go forth to the coloured nations of the world and they will look to Battersea and say Battersea has done many things in the past, but the greatest thing it has done has been to show that it has no racial prejudice and that it recognises a man for the work he has done.";

Archer moved to the left during his years in Battersea and was re-elected to the Council as a Labour representative in 1919. He stood without success for parliament the same year. In 1918 he became President of the African Progress Union, working for black empowerment and equality.
In 1919 he was a British delegate to the Pan-African Congress in Paris. Two years later he chaired the Pan-African Congress in London. 

In 1922, Archer acted as Labour Party secretary election agent for Shapurji Saklatvala, a Communist activist standing for parliament in North Battersea. He convinced the Labour Party to endorse Saklatvala and he was duly elected one of the first black MPs in Britain. He and Saklatvala continued to work together, winning again in 1924 until the Communist and Labour parties split fully. In 1929, Archer was agent for the official Labour candidate who won in the general election, beating Saklatvala.

Archer served as a governor of Battersea Polytechnic, President of the Nine Elms Swimming Club, Chair of the Whitley Council Staff Committee and a member of the Wandsworth Board of Guardians.
At the time of his death in 1932, he was deputy leader of Battersea council. He died on Thursday 14 July 1932, just a few weeks after his 69th birthday. His funeral was held at the Church of Our Lady of Carmel in Battersea Park Road on Tuesday 19 July, and was buried in the Council s cemetery at Morden.

In 2004, John Archer was chosen for the 100 Great Black Britons list, coming 72nd in a public vote.

The Clue in the Diary is a 1932 novel featuring Nancy Drew, a fictional character who has appeared in many other novels. It was reissued in 1962.

This is the last manuscript Mildred Wirt Benson wrote in her initial run. Benson would return for volume 11, The Clue of the Broken Locket, and remain with the series until 1948, returning for one last ghostwrite in 1953.

Plot summary.

The Clue in the Diary introduces Ned Nickerson, an admirer of Nancy for life. Nancy and her friends Bess and George, on the way home from a carnival, discuss a struggling Swedish immigrant, Mrs. Swenson, and her daughter. The girls helped the underprivileged duo to better enjoy the attractions (paid for things).

As they are driving, a luxurious roadside estate bursts into flames.  The girls park the car and make sure that no one is trapped inside. In doing so, Nancy sees someone fleeing the property, and discovers an anonymous Swedish diary on the ground. She picks up this clue, and as firefighters and viewers arrive on the scene, notes an attractive young man moving her car away from the flying embers. At first suspicious, Nancy warms to him when he helps her out of a jamb. Meanwhile, Mrs. Swenson's husband is missing, and she identifies that his diary is the one picked up at the fire. To top it all off, the owner of the burned house, Felix Raybolt is missing, and his wife claims Joe Swenson has murdered her husband. Raybolt, it turns out, swindles creative inventors like Swenson out of patents and copyrights on their inventions and used an invention to start the fire.

1962 edition.

The 1962 volume tells essentially the same story, eliminating some detail and subplots, and adding a new, very quickly resolved subplot involving mail fraud. (Many series fans question the addition of a mail fraud subplot, which appears trite in this case. By 1962, this plot device existed in both Nancy's Mysterious Letter and The Hidden Window Mystery.) Nancy struggles to decipher the diary and find the two missing men, aided by her best friends, and a new friend for life, Ned Nickerson.

The cover art for this book has not changed since 1950, when the revision art was introduced by Bill Gillies.

<doc id="5856556" title="Maerad" nonfiltered="409" processed="405" dbindex="1480412">
Maerad is the principal character of the first two books of Pellinor: The Gift, and The Riddle by the fantasy writer Alison Croggon.

Birth and early life.


Maerad was born into the Inner Circle of the School of Pellinor, the daughter of the first Bard, Milana, and her husband, Dorn, a member of the nomadic Pilanel race. She is a member of the House of Karn, which was virtually destroyed in the sack of Pellinor. As they attempted escape, the young Maerad and her mother were betrayed by the corrupt Enkir, later first Bard of Norloch and were sold into slavery to the petty feudal tyrant Gilman. Though thought to have perished along with Dorn, her brother Cai survived and was stolen by Bards who have turned from the Light, known as Hulls, the undead servants of the Nameless One, Sharma, who seeks to keep the Treesong split and hidden from the Elementals.

In the belief that Cai was in fact thought to be the Foretold, he was taken by the Hulls (whom he refers to as Black Bards) to an orphanage, where they attempted to corrupt him to the Dark. They changed Cai's name to Hem, to better reflect his new life in the North, as this is a common name amongst the Pilani.

The Gift.

Meanwhile, Maerad and her mother lived at Gilman's Cot, as slaves. Weakened by her broken spirit, Milana died before Maerad reached puberty, and she lived alone, fulfilling her duties from then onwards. Though she was a vulnerable girl, she appears to have managed to avoid the more harsh and degrading punishments meted out to female slaves as even as an untrained Bard she was considered to be witch-like and capable of placing the "evil eye" on those who sought to treat her roughly. When Cadvan of Lirigon came through the Cot, ensorcelled in a glimmerspell to hide him, Maerad saw him, and he realised that she was an untrained Bard. He agreed to assist her escape from Gilman and took her to the School of Innail, where Maerad learns of her heritage for the first time and begins her training in Bardic studies. She is also loved by Dernhil of Gent, a scholar, who subsequently voluntarily sacrifices his life to ensure Hulls in the service of Enkir are unable to persue Cadvan and Maerad out of Innail.

During Cadvan and Maerad's journey to the Annaren capital, Norloch, they enter the realm of Ardina, an Elemental being who rules the idyllic forest-realm of Rachida, and learn of Maerad's Elemental blood. Upon their exit from Rachida, they rescue a small boy named Hem as he seeks to hide from Hulls in the Valverras waste who had murdered the Pilani travellers who had rescued him. After much talk, they realise they are brother and sister, and that they belong to the illustrious house of Pellinor.

With the assistance of Dernhil's research, Cadvan uncovers Maerad's destiny as the Foretold One: she who will wrest the Treesong back into the Light and worst the Nameless One even in his greatest uprising. It is in the city of Norloch Cadvan's mentor, Nelac confirms this to be the case as he initiates Maerad as a full Bard, whereupon her truename is revealed to be that prophecised, Elednor, the Fire-Lily of Edil-Amarandh. It is here that Maerad also encounters Enkir, now first bard of Norloch and is forced to flee with Cadvan to the Island nation of Thorold. She also comes into the speech which allows her to converse fully with other Bards and animals, including her horse, Imi and Cadvan's stallion, Darsor.

The Riddle.

Further signs are given in Thorold that something is wrong at the heart of the Light, when the Rite of Renewal nearly fails and is only completed at the timely intervention of Cadvan and that Maerad's role in this is more complicated than that of a normal Bard. We are also given the first inidcation that she is susceptible to the temptations of the Dark and she is warned that her greatest danger my be to herself. We are also told of the split-song and how the Treesong was split by Sharma, the Nameless One in his attempt to become immortal in a similar manner to the Elementals, who owned the Treesong. In order to prevail against the Dark and the Nameless, Cadvan and Maerad must journey north to uncover the secret of the Treesong.

Surviving an attack at sea by a Stormdog, a weather creature created by the Winterking Arkan, the journey North sees a deterioration in the relationship between Cadvan and Maerad. This is further exacerbated when She accidentally kills Ilar of Lirigon, a bard of Cadvan's School who attempts to take them into custody after they are named as outlaws by Enkir. This is taken by Cadvan to be a sign of Maerad's seduction by the Dark and her elemental powers, and when they are attacked in the mountain passes by the servants of the Winterking, Maerad is distressed to find she is no longer able to join her own power to that of Cadvan, which seemingly results in his death in an avalanche (in fact Darsor has saved both Cadvan and himnself by bolting into a cave in the side of the mountain).

Rescued by Ardina, the dying Maerad is tended by Mirka, a mountain woman and a member of the Pilani. Upon her recovery Maerad journeys to the Pilani cpaital, Murask where she is introduced to more long-lost family, Sirkana their leader, who is revealed to be her Father's twin sister, and her cousin, Dharin. Dharin is tasked with taking Maerad to the Fire Islands to consult the Wise Kindred regarding the Treesong. Following her meeting with their Singer, she is captured by Jusaack raiders, in the service of an Elemental, the Winterking Arkan, and taken to his stronghold, Arkan-da, where she is enchanted and kept beneath his sway, as he thinks to keep her with him, forever enchanted to be his Queen. Though he is in some ways cold and cruel, Maerad find the Elemental part of her attracted to Arkan, and her hatred of him is tempered when she discovers he has been betrayed by the Nameless and does not consider himself Sharma's ally. In her conversations with the Winterking she learns that her lyre, which belonged to her mother Milana, bears runes which form one half of the treesong. Although Arkan can tell her what they mean, he is unable to reveal the music of the Treesong. It is believed that Sharma, the nameless, has the other half of the song in his domain of Den Raven in the south. 

Ardina helps Maerad to escape in the form of a Wolf, which she transforms into using her Elemental powers, simulataneously creating a semblance of herself to confuse Arkan. Together they escape the fury of Arkan who unleashes a terrible storm upon them, and journey with a wolf pack to the Annaren border. Still in wolf form, she is drawn back to the destroyed city of Pellinor where she finds Cadvan and Darsor camping among the ruins, having been told by Ardina to await her return there. She assumes human form again - much to Cadvan's surprise, and they resume their quest.



Since the third book in the series, The Crow, deals with Hem's journey to the south with the Bard Saliman, we expect to take up Maerad's story once more in the final instalment, The Singing.

Appearance.

Maerad is of average height. Unlike her brother, Hem, she is more Annaren than Pilani in appearance, with Pale skin, long black hair and blue eyes. She is roughly 16-17 years of age.

Since her kidnap and capture by the Winterking in the events of The Riddle, she has only 3 fingers on her left hand, the result of frostbite in the frozen wastes of Zamarkan.

Powers and Abilities.
Some members of the House of Karn have Elidhu blood, and as such their skill, proficiency and raw power at Bardic Magic and Magery is extremely high. The power of Pellinor allows Maerad to have incredible strength at magery, and she has used her skills in several feats. She has:
Created a living lion from a rock (never before done by a mortal);
Held up against an attack from a pure Elidhu, the Landrost;
Aided in the creation of powerful magics that was impossible before her arrival,
Seen through the Illusory Veil cast by the Arkan, the Winterking Elidhu,
Located her brother Hem in the Valverras Waste;
Killed a Kulag, and;
Simultaeneously defeated several Hulls and a Wight of the Abyss single-handedly.
She can also speak  Annaren, and both the Speech, and the language of the Elidhu.
Under the encouragement of Ardina, she has also learnt to alter her shape, spending several days as a member of a Wolf Pack in order to escape from the Winterking.

Possessions.
Due to her period as a slave, Maerad owns very few possessions. What she does have are kept in her travelling pack and include:
A mystical Lyre, thought to be Dhyllic ware created by Nelsor of Afinil. This is inscribed with ancient Runes which form one half of the Treesong.
A book of poems given to her by Dernhil of Gent;
Ring given to her by Ardina ;
Prior to her imprisonment in Arkan-da, her sword and helm.
A coat of chainmail.
A set of Elidhu pipes.

<doc id="8294882" title="Petro Kassui Kibe" nonfiltered="411" processed="407" dbindex="1480414">
Petro Kassui Kibe (1587 - July 4, 1639) was a Japanese Christian during 17th century and a Jesuit priest.  Before reaching Rome, he became the first Japanese to visit Jerusalem.  After he came back to Japan, he was martyred.  He saw the largest part of the world in medieval Japanese.  He is called "Japanese Marco Polo" or "A Christian walking thru the world".

Life.
For Rome.
In 1568, Petro Kibe was born in Kibe, Kunisaki in Bungo (At present, Kibe Kunimi-town Kunisaki-city Oita prefecture), Japan.  His parents were both Christians.  He started to learn at a seminaryo, a theological school, at age of 13.  In 1606, he aspired to be a Jesuit and began to tell his name "Kassui".  It is not known why he named himself "Kassui".  Since then his name had been described "Petro Kassui Kibe" in Jesuit documents.

In 1614, he was exiled to Macau due to a deportation order of Christians.  He learned Latin and theology at a theological school in Macau.  However, he and other Japanese knew it would be hard to be priests because of nationality discrimination, so they left the school to go to Rome.

He went to Malacca and Goa in India by ship, and then Kibe left for Europe on foot via Persia.  Via Hormuz and Baghdad, he finally became the first Japanese Christian to arrive at Jerusalem.  It took three years to arrive at Rome beyond the Mediterranean Sea after a difficult journey.  

From Macau, a letter telling "Japanese who left Macau would go to Rome, but don't talk to them." was sent to Rome.  However in Rome, Jesuits examined Kibe and found out he had enough knowledge and was suited for a priest.  On November 15, 1620, he became a Jesuit priest at age of 32 at the Basilica of St. John Lateran.

Afterward, he was trained at Jesuit training school for two years in Rome, and then he swore as a Jesuit priest in Lisbon.  In 1623, he departed for India with twenty Jesuits.  Next year, he arrived at Goa via Cape of Good Hope.

Return to Home.

Father Kibe had a strong decision of returning to Japan with taking the risk of being a martyr though Japan oppressed Christians and Christian priests' entry to Japan was forbidden.  He had a very hard time of finding a ship which allowed the Christian priest to board.  He traveled around Southeast Asia, and then finally he succeeded to get on a ship from Manila to Japan in 1630.  The ship wrecked, but reached Kagoshima in southern Japan.  He returned to Japan sixteen years after he left home.

Father Kibe hid himself and escaped from severe oppression and exposure.  He went to northeast Japan via Nagasaki and encouraged Christians.  In 1639, he was found out when he hid himself at home of a Christian and was arrested.  He was sent to Edo (Tokyo at present).  He met Christovao Ferreira who had already rejected his faith of Christianity, but Kibe strongly recommended Ferreira to return to the faith.  Father Kibe was tortured severely, but he never rejected his faith.  He still encouraged another Christian even in a hole for torturing to death, so he was pulled out of the hole then beheaded to be martyred.  He was 52 years old.  He looked at the world and lived a stormy life.

In Kibe Kunimi-town Kunisaki-city Oita prefecture, there is Father Kibe Memorial Park which was founded by Father Sekki.  Kibe's statute which is made by Yasutake Funakoshi stands at the park.  On May 7th, 2006, Roman Curio Congregation for the Causes of Saints decided Father Kibe and other 187 Japanese Christians who martyred should be celebrated.  It means an informal decision of canonization; therefore he will be canonized in the future.

<doc id="1963943" title="William James Mayo" nonfiltered="412" processed="408" dbindex="1480415">


William James Mayo (June 29, 1861   July 28, 1939) was a physician in the United States and a co-founder of the Mayo Clinic.  He was born to William Worrall Mayo and his wife Louise in Le Sueur, Minnesota.

The United States Postal Service printed a stamp depicting him and his brother, Charles Horace Mayo, on September 11, 1964.

Early years.
As a child, William and his brother Charles frequently accompanied their father as he went about his business as a pioneer physician. They began by helping out with very menial tasks, and were gradually given more responsibility. Eventually, the boys were acting as anesthesiologists and tying off blood vessels. 

On a stormy night at the age of 16, Will accompanied his father to an abandoned hotel where one of the elder Mayo's patients worked as the caretaker. The patient had just died and Dr. Mayo was going to perform an autopsy.  Will stood by and watched the procedure and after about an hour, it was time to go to another patient's home. Dr. Mayo asked his son to stay behind and clean up.  "Sew up the incisions and then tuck the sheet around the corpse. When you finish, go right home." Will nervously began to stitch up the incisions on the body and recounted the incident many years later saying, "I'm about as proud of the fact that I walked out, instead of ran, as of anything else I ever made myself do."

Education and professional work.
Mayo earned his medical degree from the University of Michigan in 1883. Afterwards he returned to Rochester to practice medicine along side his father and his brother Charles. 

On August 21, 1883, a terrible tornado struck Rochester, killing 24 people and seriously injuring over 40 others.  One-third of the town was destroyed, but young Dr. Will and his family escaped serious harm.  The relief efforts began immediately with a temporary hospital being established at the town's dance hall. The Mayo Drs. were extensively involved in treating the injured who were brought there for help. Mother Alfred Moes and the Sisters of Saint Francis were called in to act as nurses (despite the fact they were trained as teachers and had little if any medical experience).

After the crisis had subsided, Mother Alfred Moes approached William Worrall Mayo about establishing a hospital in Rochester.  On September 30, 1889, the dream became reality as Saint Mary's Hospital opened its doors. Dr. W.W. Mayo (who by this time was 70 years of age) became the consulting physician and surgeon at the hospital, and his two sons, began seeing patients and performing surgery with the assistance of the Sisters of Saint Francis.
